seed_quests.py - put the example questlines into a config directory.

Why this is a script and not something the mod does
---------------------------------------------------
Tasked ships no quests. It is a quest *engine*, and a mod that installs example chapters into
every player's config directory has decided something that is not its to decide: the first thing a
pack author would have to do is delete somebody else's content, and every file a mod ships is a file
that has to keep working forever against a format that is still moving.

So the worked examples live here, beside this script, and they reach a config directory when somebody
asks for them:

    python tasked/tools/seed_quests.py <dir> [<dir>...]     any config/tasked/quests directories
    python tasked/tools/seed_quests.py --workspace          this repo's own test setup

A `<dir>` is a `config/tasked/quests` directory - the one the mod reads. It is created if it is not
there.

Nothing is overwritten unless you say so
----------------------------------------
An existing file is left exactly as it is, and that is the point rather than a nicety. This directory
is where an author's own questline lives, so a tool that refreshed it on every run would destroy work
and be indistinguishable from a bug -- which is the same failure the mod used to have, arriving from
the other direction.

So there are two ways to get a pristine copy, and neither is silent: delete the file and run this
again, or pass `--force`. `--force` names each file it replaces, so a replace is never something that
happened while you were not looking.

**One file is merged rather than replaced, even under `--force`: a group manifest.** `group.json` is
not only an example file -- the editor writes to it too, adding a folder to `chapters` when a chapter
is created -- and the loader refuses the whole group when a folder is present and unlisted, which
loads as an empty book with the reason one line up. Replacing the list would orphan the author's
chapters, so a forced copy keeps the destination's own entries alongside the shipped ones. See
`merge_group_chapters`.

`--reset` is the third way, and the loudest: it deletes everything in each target's quest directory
-- every file and folder, not only the ones this script wrote -- and then copies the examples in
fresh. That is the flag for a wholesale replacement like the one that collapsed twelve example
questlines into one chapter: without it the old groups sit beside the new one and load as extra
content, and with `--force` alone they would survive as stale folders. It is never implied by any
other flag, it names every entry it removes, and `--dry-run` reports exactly the same removals while
touching nothing. `--force` is still the flag for replacing files; `--reset` is for starting over.

`--reset` keeps `_`-prefixed entries, because the `_` prefix means the same thing here as
everywhere else in this project: deliberately out of the loader's way. A test combo's
`_example_typos.json` and friends are fixtures a person renames to run, not stale content, and a
reset that deleted them would be the one place the convention did not hold.

`--workspace` seeds every test combo and both Modrinth profiles, and is the mode this project uses.
It is also why this script is here rather than in `.utils/`: it belongs to the Tasked repository, so
it travels with the examples it copies, and a separate checkout of Tasked gets both.

Files beginning with `_` are **not** copied, at any level. Those are deliberately-broken fixtures -
the loader skips them by that prefix - and copying one would install a questline whose only purpose is
to fail. The same prefix is why `_schema/` is here at all: it is a folder of editor schemas beside the
content, and the rule is what keeps the loader from error-walling on a folder the mod ships itself.

It also **removes the version-1 files it has replaced.** Converting an install means the same
questline exists twice -- once as `01_stone_age.json`, once as `getting_started/` -- and leaving both
is not a stale copy, it is two questlines: every group, chapter and quest in the pair is reported as a
duplicate id. So a root-level `.json` whose declared chapter groups are all provided by folders that
were just copied is deleted, and anything else at that level is **kept and named**, with the reason.
See `sweep_legacy_flat_files` for the rule and why it is stated in ids rather than in file names.

    — right for the flat format, where a file *is* a whole tree, and silently empty under the folder
    format, where every quest is four levels down inside `getting_started/first_steps/`. A glob that
    matches nothing is not an error: this would have copied no files at all, printed a cheerful
    summary of zero, and left the caller with an empty quest book and nothing in any log to explain

    Delete the version-1 flat files that the folder tree beside them has replaced.

    ## Why this is a deletion, and why it is not `--force`'s job

    Converting an install means the same questline exists twice: once as `01_stone_age.json`, and once
    as `getting_started/`. Leaving both is worse than a stale copy — it is *two questlines*, and every
    group, chapter and quest in the pair is reported as a duplicate id. The message an author gets
    names 01_stone_age.json and a file inside the folder as the two sides of a clash, which reads as a
    broken conversion rather than as a file that needs deleting.

    So the script tidies up after itself, and it is the only thing in this repository that deletes a
    quest file. That is why the rule it deletes by is narrow, and why every case it *declines* is
    named out loud rather than passed over.

    ## The rule

    A `*.json` directly at the target's quest root is deleted **only if** every chapter-group id it
    declares is also provided by a group folder that was just copied. So:

      * `01_stone_age.json`, declaring `getting_started`, goes — because `getting_started/group.json`
        is now there. That is exactly the stale copy.
      * An author's own `my_questline.json`, declaring a group of its own, **stays**, and is named.
        Nothing copied declares that group, so it is not a copy of anything this script wrote, and it
        is not this script's to remove.

    Matching on ids rather than on file names is the point. A name list would be a thing that goes
    stale — the four names live in this file's history and nowhere else now — and it would delete
    `01_stone_age.json` even if an author had rewritten it into something of their own.

    ## What it will not do

    No directory is deleted. An empty group folder is a legitimate placeholder, and a script that
    removed folders would eventually remove one an author had just made.

    `_`-prefixed files are left alone entirely: that prefix is how a file is deliberately kept out of
    the loader's way, so removing one would defeat the convention.

    A file that will not parse is left alone and named. It is not a v1 file this can recognise, and
    deleting a file this cannot read is the one thing a tidy-up must never do.
