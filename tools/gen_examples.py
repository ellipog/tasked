"""
gen_examples.py - write the worked examples: one group, one chapter, every feature.

Why one chapter
---------------
The examples used to be twelve questlines, one per mechanism family, because that was the only
way to show every field and every value of every enum: a chapter wears one theme and one
progression mode, so demonstrating fifteen themes took fifteen chapters. Twelve questlines is
also a lot of reading, and the reader who wants to see "how do I write an OR-gate" should not
have to learn which of twelve groups happens to hold one.

So the exhibition is one chapter now: `first_light/first_steps`, a single orrery of about
seventy quests. It keeps the five onboarding quests at its western edge -- their ids and their
mechanics are pinned by `QuestPlaythroughTest`, which walks them by name -- and everything else
orbits a hub: seven arms, each a family of mechanisms, every node carrying the field it
demonstrates in its own description.

What this script is
-------------------
The files are the content; this script is how they are written, so a clone of Tasked can
regenerate them rather than hand-editing seventy JSON documents. It is table-driven: one entry
per quest, a polar layout pass that turns an arm and a slot into canvas coordinates, and a
**coverage check** that fails before anything is written if a task type, a reward mode, a
condition, a shape, a line-axis value or a visibility flag has gone missing. That check is the
generator's half of the contract `QuestIndexTest` enforces on the output; between them, "every
feature" is not a claim in a README, it is something the build refuses to lose.

The script owns `first_light/` and `reward_tables/` and rewrites both from scratch on every
run. Other group folders it only *reports*: an author's own content beside the examples is not
this script's to delete.
