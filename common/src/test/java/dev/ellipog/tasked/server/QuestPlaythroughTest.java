/**
 * Stage 3's exit condition, played rather than argued.
 *
 * <h2>What this is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>The plan's bar for Stage 3 is: <i>"you can complete an entire questline through commands, with
 * no GUI, and two players on a dedicated server share progress correctly."</i> Until now the engine
 * was checked only as a set of pure functions — {@code ProgressionEngineTest} hands the resolver a
 * quest index and some progress and reads states back, which is the right way to test the <i>rules</i>
 * and says nothing about whether anything connects.
 *
 * <p>Everything between those rules and a player was unverified, and the gap is not theoretical:
 * {@code /tasked progress}, {@code submit} and {@code complete} all call
 * {@code getPlayerOrException()}, so none of them had ever actually run. They compile. Nothing proved
 * they execute.
 *
 * <h2>How it runs</h2>
 *
 * <p>A real server, a real world, a real {@code ServerPlayer} — see {@link HeadlessServer} for why the
 * GameTest framework could not be borrowed and its recipe was copied instead. Commands go through the
 * server's own dispatcher with the player attached as the source's entity, which is the same source
 * shape a command block gets when it acts on a player.
 *
 * <h2>The one seam, and it is worth naming</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine's automatic half is driven by a <i>player tick</i> that fires from each loader's event,
 * and no loader is present in a test, so nothing fires it. {@link #tickUntil} calls
 * {@code ProgressService.tick} directly, which is what the loader would call. So the automatic
 * evaluation is exercised through its real entry point but not through the real <i>trigger</i>; the
 * trigger is three lines in {@code Tasked.listen} and is covered by the loader's own event tests.
 *
 * <h2>Why the transcript shows translation keys</h2>
 *
 * <p>A dedicated server has no language file loaded, so {@code Component.getString()} on a translatable
 * returns the key: the transcript reads {@code tasked.command.complete.done} rather than English. That
 * is why <b>nothing here asserts on output text</b>. The return value is the assertion — 0 for a
 * refusal, 1 for a change — which is also sturdier: rewording or translating a message cannot break
 * these tests, and a test that matched on English would pass while the message was wrong for everyone
 * not playing in it.
 *
 * <h2>Ordered, because a playthrough is a sequence</h2>
 *
 * <p>A quest unlocking is a consequence of the previous quest completing, so these run in order and
 * carry state between them deliberately. That is the opposite of the usual rule for tests and is the
 * point here: the thing being tested is a chain, and splitting it into independent cases would test
 * five invocations of the resolver instead of one playthrough.

     * <h2>What was actually wrong here</h2>
     *
     * <p>The next three tests are the plan's second Stage 3 clause — <i>"two players on a dedicated
     * server share progress correctly"</i> — and writing them found a real defect rather than
     * confirming a design.
     *
     * <p>{@code ProgressService} keys progress by <b>team id</b>, and its class comment said sharing
     * therefore "falls out rather than needing to be built". That is true of the <i>storage</i> and it
     * was false of the <i>counting</i>, which is the half nobody looks at. {@code tick} chose one
     * member per team, by player-list order — whoever logged in first — and {@code evaluateTeam}
     * counted item tasks in that one member's inventory. The parameter was even named
     * {@code anyMember}, which is the tell: for a task that asks whether <i>somebody</i> in the party
     * has eight logs, who you ask looks like it should not matter.
     *
     * <p>It matters completely, and it is wrong in exactly the case parties exist for. One of you
     * gathers the wood, and the wood is in <i>their</i> inventory. Ask the other one and the party
     * sees nothing — and the failure presents as "the quest never completes", which sends you to the
     * quest file rather than to the loop.
     *
     * <h2>Why the tests alternate who holds the items</h2>
     *
     * <p>This is the design that makes them worth having, and it is deliberate rather than tidy.
     * Giving the items to the non-owner is a stronger test than giving them to the owner, because the
     * old bug chose by player-list order and the owner tends to be first. But a fixed "always give
     * them to the friend" would still pass if somebody later picked a representative by a
     * <i>different</i> fixed rule — say the last member, or the one with the highest UUID.
     *
     * <p>So the direction reverses: {@link #aPartySharesOneProgressRecord} has the friend gather, and
     * {@link #theOtherPlayerGatheringWorksToo} has the owner gather. <b>No single chosen member can
     * pass both.</b> That is the whole reason there are two of them.

     * <p>Order 5 asserts that the engine's automatic push happens — a tick completes a quest and
     * reports the team as changed, which is what fixed "the quest book still says 0/8". That push goes
     * through {@code ProgressService.tick}, and the two tests below are about the changes a tick
     * <b>cannot</b> see at all. Both were half-built in the committed code and neither had a test:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li><b>A command.</b> {@code evaluateTeam} skips every quest that is not playable, so a quest
     *       that is already COMPLETED is never reported as changed again, however often it is ticked.
     *       {@code /tasked reset} and {@code /tasked claim} both move something a client is showing and
     *       are both invisible to the tick. {@code /tasked complete} likewise.</li>
     *   <li><b>A team change.</b> {@code REASON_TEAM_CHANGED} existed, {@code sendProgress} implemented
     *       the full-sync-on-team-change branch, and nothing ever sent one — the two listeners on
     *       Armature's team events logged and returned.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>Both are asserted by counting messages, not by inspecting the wire, and the reason is stated
     * where the counter lives: a loader is absent here, so "did a message get produced" is the only
     * question a test can ask, and counting at the one place a message is produced means a route
     * nobody thought of is counted too.

     *
     * <h2>What is deliberately not asserted, and it is the same gap as the team listeners</h2>
     *
     * <p>Nothing here counts the messages a party command produces. It cannot: the stored source
     * answers {@code firesEvents()} true, so {@code pushMembershipChange} correctly declines to push
     * and leaves it to the event — and those listeners are registered from {@code SERVER_STARTED},
     * which no test JVM fires. See order 18. So a party built by command here tells nobody anything,
     * and that is the harness's shape rather than a fault in the command.
     *
     * <p>What <i>is</i> asserted is everything the command is responsible for that has a state to
     * read back: the party exists, the player's progress moved onto it, and the mode reached the store
     * and then the engine.

     * {@code tasked/tools/quests} and both skip anything whose name begins with {@code _}.
     *
     * <h2>Recursive, and it had to become recursive for the same reason the script did</h2>
     *
     * <p>It was a single {@code Files.list} over the quest directory, copying each {@code .json} whose
     * name did not begin with an underscore. That is exactly right for the flat format, where a file
     * <i>is</i> a whole tree, and it silently copies nothing at all under the folder format — where the
     * quests are four levels down inside {@code first_light/first_steps/} and no file at the top
     * level is a quest.
     *
     * <p>The failure that produces is worth naming because of how it reads. The seeding step succeeds,
     * the load succeeds, and the quest book is empty — so the first place anyone looks is the loader,
     * which is working. Worse, this test's own {@code filesFound} assertion would have compared 0 with
     * the number of top-level files and passed, because both sides were counting the same nothing.
     *
     * <p>So it walks, and it applies the underscore rule to <b>every path segment</b> rather than to the
     * final name — the same rule {@code DeclaredPaths.isIgnored} states, and for the same reason: the
     * shipped {@code _schema} folder is a directory, and a rule that only tested the file's own name
     * would happily copy every one of its contents into a config directory.
     *
     * <p>Returns {@code /}-separated relative paths, not bare file names, because under the folder
     * format a name is not unique — {@code group.json} appears once per group and {@code chapter.json}
     * once per chapter.
