/**
 * A real Minecraft server, in the test JVM, with a real {@code ServerPlayer} on it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists, and why not GameTest</h2>
 *
 * <p>Stage 3's exit is "a whole questline completable through commands, with a player".
 * {@code /tasked progress}, {@code submit} and {@code complete} all begin with
 * {@code getPlayerOrException()}, and there is no player at a server console -- so the playthrough
 * cannot be scripted from a console, and the only way to run it is to have a player.
 *
 * <p>The obvious answer is vanilla's GameTest framework, and it is not usable here.
 * {@code GameTestServer.create} throws on an empty test collection, so it cannot be borrowed as a
 * plain server; and a {@code TestFunction} needs a structure template, which a release server does
 * not ship. The <i>framework</i> needs ceremony that is about its own job; what is wanted is only
 * its <b>recipe</b>, which is fifteen lines and is copied here rather than invented:
 * {@code GameTestHelper.makeMockServerPlayerInLevel} is the canonical way to get a working player
 * without a client, and the boot sequence below mirrors {@code GameTestServer.create}.
 *
 * <h2>Why a real server rather than a constructed player</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a bare {@code new ServerPlayer(server, level, profile, info)} is not usable, and its
 * failure is at the last line rather than the first. {@code ProgressService.complete} ends in
 * {@code player.displayClientMessage(...)}, which goes through {@code ServerPlayer.connection} --
 * set only by {@code PlayerList.placeNewPlayer}. A constructed player has that field null, so every
 * completion would throw after doing its real work: the progress would be saved, the rewards
 * granted, and the command would still report an exception. Handing the player a connection is the
 * difference between a test of the engine and a test of where the engine stops.
 *
 * <p>So this is real in every part that matters: a real world loaded from the real vanilla datapack,
 * a real {@code SavedData} for progress, a real command dispatcher, and a real player who is on the
 * server's player list. Nothing here is a stub of the thing being tested.
 *
 * <h2>The one seam, stated plainly</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine's own entry point is a <i>player tick</i> hook, which fires from each loader's event
 * and therefore does not fire in a test. A test that wants the automatic half of the engine --
 * "eight oak logs in the inventory completes Punch a Tree" -- has to call
 * {@link dev.ellipog.tasked.progress.ProgressService#tick} itself. That is one call, and it is the
 * only thing here that does not go through a loader-supplied path. It is called on the server
 * thread, so the threading is the same as in play.
 *
 * <h2>Why commands are dispatched off the player's own source</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code /tasked} reads its player with {@code getPlayerOrException()}, which returns
 * {@code this.entity} when it is a {@code ServerPlayer} and throws otherwise. So the source is the
 * server's own -- which is what a real command would use for position, level and permission -- with
 * {@code withEntity(player)} attaching the player as the entity. That is not a test-only trick: it
 * is the same source shape a command block or a console-driven command gets when it acts on a
 * player, and it means the command body runs unchanged.
