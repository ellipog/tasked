/**
 * The registry wrapper around every condition behaviour forwards the behaviour.
 *
 * <p>The condition half of {@code TaskBehaviourForwardingTest}, kept for the same reason. The condition
 * behaviour has one method today, so a wrapper that dropped it would look like a condition that is
 * simply never met — not a crash, not a compile error, but every gated task and reward silently
 * refusing. That is the exact shape of the item task's lost {@code takesResources}.
 *
 * <p>The wrapper is called directly, which is why it is package-private: registering a test-only
 * condition type into the shared registry would leave it registered for every other test in the JVM,
 * and the sweeps that walk {@code ids()} nondeterministically start failing in classes that never
 * met it. The same trade, and the same note, as {@code QuestPanelLayout.typeRows(String, Set)}.
