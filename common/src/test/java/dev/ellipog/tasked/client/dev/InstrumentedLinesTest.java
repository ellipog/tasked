/**
 * The four instrumented lines must be readable, and this is what says so.
 *
 * <h2>Why a structural test rather than an assertion about behaviour</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every one of these instruments had a passing unit test — the tally counts, the ratio divides, the switch
 * gates — and **two of them had never once been written to a log.** They were emitted at {@code LOG.debug}
 * while the mod has no way to raise the log level, so {@code grep} over a full session found zero occurrences:
 * an instrument nothing can read is not an instrument, and the baseline table had two rows nobody could fill
 * because of how they were written.
 *
 * <p>No behavioural test can catch that. It is not a fault in what the code computes; it is a fault in whether
 * the answer ever reaches a person. So this reads the source and asserts the level, which is the only place the
 * fault is visible — and it is the same shape as {@code check_duplicates.py}: a rule about the code that the
 * code cannot state about itself.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule is not "never use debug".</b> It is that a line <i>named in the baseline table</i> has to be
 * readable by default, because the table is filled by a person reading a log. A debug line that is not in the
 * table is fine and there are several.

     * <p><b>`edit flush` is the fifth and it was added after the first four were fixed</b>, which is the
