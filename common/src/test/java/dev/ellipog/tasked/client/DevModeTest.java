/**
 * Developer mode: the flag, its file, its per-kind widths, and what a bad file does.
 *
 * <h2>Why the file is worth this many tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because it is a switch that changes what a screen shows, and the two ways it can be wrong are both
 * silent: a typo could leave it stuck on (a book with tools nobody asked for), or a file that cannot be
 * read could leave it stuck off with no way to tell -- and neither prints anything on screen. The
 * tolerance is therefore asserted rather than assumed: no file, empty file, not JSON, wrong type and an
 * unknown field all end at "off, and the client still runs", which is the direction that cannot lie
 * about what is on screen.
 *
 * <h2>And why the widths get as many again</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because they are the one part of this file that is a <b>table</b>, and a table has more ways to be
 * wrong than a flag: a name this build does not have, a name it has but that means nothing as a rail
 * ({@code NONE}), a value that is not a number, and a number outside the kind's own range are each a
 * different fault with the same consequence if it is not handled -- a panel that opens at a width its own
 * layout cannot be read at. Each is asserted to cost that one entry and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>It holds settings that are <b>not</b> gated on the mode -- snap, the sidebar's bars, the fold and the
 * widths -- and that is asserted here too, because a preference that silently required developer mode
 * would be a switch nobody could find the effect of.
