/**
 * The quest book's layout, tested without a game.
 *
 * <h2>What this exists to prevent</h2>
 *
 * <p>A screenshot showed two buttons drawn on top of each other in the
 * bottom-right corner. The cause was that "near the bottom right" was written twice, as two
 * expressions that were equal only by coincidence:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Open: canvasRight() - 78,               canvasBottom() + 11
 * Done: panelLeft() + panelWidth() - 68,  panelTop() + panelHeight() - 24
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code canvasRight() == panelLeft() + panelWidth()}, so the two landed about ten pixels apart in
 * x and fifteen in y — which is to say, on top of each other.
 *
 * <p>The immediate fix was to compute each shared position once. <b>This is the durable fix.</b> The
 * arithmetic now lives in {@link BookGeometry}, which has no Minecraft in it, so the property that was
 * violated can be stated as a test and checked over every window size rather than at one:
 *
 * <pre>
 * no two controls overlap, and every control is inside the surface it belongs to
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Reproducing the old bug for the record: at 427x240 GUI pixels — the size the screenshot was
 * taken at — the old Open rectangle was {@code 329,185 70x18} and the old Done was
 * {@code 339,196 60x18}. Those intersect. Every test below that sweeps window sizes would have failed
 * on the old arithmetic.
 *
 * <p>Both of those controls are gone — Open with the summary strip, Done replaced by a close button —
 * so the pair is now reconstructed inside the test that reproduces it rather than existing in the
 * layout. The rectangles are kept verbatim because their <i>overlap</i> is the evidence that the sweep
 * can fail, and that evidence does not expire when the controls do.
 *
 * <h2>Why the sweep rather than a handful of cases</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the failure mode is size-dependent. The developer's monitor is the one size that
 * certainly works, so a single-case test asserts the least interesting thing. The sweep here starts
 * deliberately smaller than any real window, because a layout that only holds together above
 * 600 pixels wide is a layout with a bug waiting for a laptop.

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code hasOpen} went with the summary strip. The Open button only existed when a quest was
     *       selected, so the map's contents depended on something that was not a property of the window
     *       at all.</li>
     *   <li>{@code chapters} has now gone too, and its removal is the larger one. The chapter rows were
     *       in this map; they are placed by a {@link dev.ellipog.armature.client.ui.kit.Stack} inside a
     *       scroll view now, so the map holds only the controls whose positions are <b>fixed</b>. Since
     *       nothing in it depends on how many chapters there are, an argument saying how many is not an

     *       does not build.</li>

     * <p>What is left is a function of the window and nothing else, which is what made it possible to
