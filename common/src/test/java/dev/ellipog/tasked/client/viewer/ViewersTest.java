/**
 * Which viewer owns the integration, checked as a rule rather than by installing one.
 *
 * <h2>Why a predicate and not three mods</h2>
 *
 * <p>The decision is the feature: a client running two viewers must see one set of quest entries,
 * and the answer is priority rather than suppression. That cannot be checked by installing viewers
 * into a test JVM -- there is no loader in one -- so {@code Viewers.choose} takes the loaded set as a
 * predicate and this hands it every subset. {@code chosen()} is the two-line runtime path over the
 * same call, so what is tested here is what a client runs.
 *
 * <h2>The one assumption</h2>
 *
 * <p>The runtime-path test relies on a test JVM having no Armature platform installed, which is the
 * same assumption {@code TeamProvidersTest} pins for the same reason: a platform that is not there
 * is read as "nothing is loaded", and that is exactly true.
