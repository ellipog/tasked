/**
 * The floating colour picker, drawn into a recorder.
 *
 * <h2>What this can see, and what it is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every fault this control has had was a drawing fault: a gradient quantised into bands, a marker that
 * vanished against one end of it, a hex field that showed a colour without the alpha that is half of what
 * it edits, and a row of quick picks that grew past the slots that fit and then silently stopped taking
 * presses. None of those is arithmetic, so none of them could be asserted; all of them are fills and text,
 * so a recorder can. The picker's own rectangles are private, so what is asserted is what a person sees:
 * where the ink is, how much of it there is, and what the text says.
 *
 * <p>No window and no client: the fields are {@code ArmatureTextField}s and {@code ScrubField}s, both of
 * which are constructed headless by their own tests.
