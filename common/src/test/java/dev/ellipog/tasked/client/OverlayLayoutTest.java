/**
 * The overlay's body, asserted without a client.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file exists at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because {@link OverlayLayout} exists, and a class that composes a layout is only worth
 * extracting if something can check what it composed. This is the reason the extraction was done:
 * {@code QuestBookScreen} extends {@code Screen}, so the height its overlay reports — which the
 * scrollbar's range is computed from — could previously only be judged by looking at a scrollbar.
 *
 * <h2>The two assertions that carry the file</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #theHeightMatchesTheHandWrittenMeasureItReplaced()} pins the total against the old
 * {@code measureOverlay} arithmetic written out longhand, so the migration is a refactor rather than
 * a quiet change of how far the pane scrolls. It uses <b>literals</b>, not this class's constants:
 * aliasing them would make the test agree with any change to them, and the point is to make a change
 * to one of those numbers a deliberate act that fails a build.
 *
 * <p>{@link #theTailIsAPlacedSlotBecauseAGapWouldNotBeCounted()} exists because the first version of
 * {@link OverlayLayout} closed with a {@code gap} and was wrong — {@code Layout.height()} is derived
 * from places slots, and a gap places none, so the trailing padding vanished and the content height
 * came out sixteen pixels short. Nothing could see that: the sixteen pixels lost are empty ones at
 * the end. That is the exact shape of the defect this whole round was about, so it gets a test whose
 * name says what the mechanism is.
