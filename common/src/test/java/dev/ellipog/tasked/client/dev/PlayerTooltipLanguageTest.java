/**
 * What a player reads, and what only an author does.
 *
 * <h2>The rule, stated once</h2>
 *
 * <p>A player's tooltip is written for somebody who has never heard of a task type: plain words, no
 * registry ids, no field names, no commands, and no more than a line or two. An <b>editor's</b> tooltip
 * may name the fields and the id, because those are what the author edits — and that is the whole of
 * what it may do: a picker row's hover is two lines, not a paragraph.
 *
 * <p>The rule had been broken quietly in both directions. Player hovers printed a raw item id on a
 * reward, a quest id on a rewards-inbox header, a tag id on a tagged task, a slash command on every
 * party button, and "Missing item: minecraft:oak_log" on a sidebar row — each with a comment
 * explaining that the id was for a bug report, which is an author's reason and not a player's. And the
 * editor's own hover had grown to three lines, the third of which repeated the type's id after the hint
 * and the fields had already named it.
 *
 * <h2>Why these four guards rather than a list of banned words</h2>
 *
 * <p>A list would be a second description of the format, and it would go stale the first time a field
 * was added. These are shapes instead: an id is {@code namespace:path} wherever it appears, and a
 * machine name is camelCase in an English sentence, because nothing else in a player-facing line ever
 * is. So a field added to the format tomorrow is caught by the shape rather than by somebody
 * remembering to extend a list — which is the same argument {@code LangSweepTest} makes about keys.
