/**
 * The sidebar: which rows exist, what they say, and where they go.
 *
 * <h2>Why this needs no window, no font and no widget</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because everything a sidebar does that can be wrong happens <i>above</i> the drawing. Which rows a
 * collapsed group hides, how deep a chapter is indented, whether a heading gets a disclosure arrow,
 * whether the height the scrollbar is given matches the rows that were placed — not one of those is a
 * question about pixels, and every one of them is a question this class answers.
 *
 * <p>That is the reason {@link SidebarLayout} exists at all rather than the answers living in
 * {@code QuestBookScreen}. The screen extends {@code Screen} and needs a running game to instantiate,
 * so a question asked of the screen is a question no test can ask — which is how the reported control
 * collision survived to a screenshot. The same argument that moved the book's rectangles into
 * {@link BookGeometry} moves the sidebar's rows here.
 *
 * <h2>The one thing this file deliberately does not test</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here asserts on pixels. The absolute x and width of a row are {@link
 * dev.ellipog.armature.client.ui.kit.Stack}'s arithmetic, and its own suite covers it; what is this
 * class's to get right is the <b>indent</b> — that a chapter is one level deeper than its heading and
 * that the indent is in the slot rather than painted on afterwards. So the assertions below are on
 * relative positions and on the indent's presence, which is the part a copy here could disagree with.
