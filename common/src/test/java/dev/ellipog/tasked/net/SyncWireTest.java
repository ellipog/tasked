/**
 * The wire itself: compression, chunking, and putting chunks back together.
 *
 * <h2>What this file is defending against, in three parts</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A decompression bomb.</b> Deflate's output size is not bounded by its input size — a few
 * kilobytes can expand to gigabytes — and the bytes arrive from a server. That server is not a
 * stranger, which is not the same as being safe: a broken or malicious pack would be able to exhaust a
 * client's memory, and the client has no way to refuse after the allocation has happened. So
 * {@link SyncWire#inflate} enforces a ceiling <i>during</i> inflation, and
 * {@link #inflateRefusesABombRatherThanAllocatingIt()} is the assertion that it does.
 *
 * <p><b>A message too large for one packet.</b> {@code ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket} carries
 * {@code MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 1048576} and uses it only as the fallback codec for an <i>unknown</i>
 * payload — so a registered payload is not held to it by anything, and exceeding it produces no error
 * naming a size. Chunking is the answer, and the tests below are that a message survives being cut up.
 *
 * <p><b>A half-assembled message.</b> A transfer whose own chunks disagree about how many there are
 * is dropped whole, because the alternative is JSON that parses in the middle and throws at the end —
 * a failure that reads as a serialiser bug rather than as a truncated packet.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here needs Minecraft. That is the point of {@link SyncWire} being a class of its own
 * rather than four methods inside the payload handlers.
