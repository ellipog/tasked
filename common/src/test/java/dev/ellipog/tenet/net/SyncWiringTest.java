/**
 * The wiring, as opposed to the parts: a message that goes through a real codec and into the handler
 * the loader was actually given.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file exists, and what the plan says about it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Stage 4's own note calls this "the single largest gap": <i>"the server declares three payloads
 * and the codecs round-trip, and nothing has ever had a quest sync pushed to it."</i> Three links
 * make that so — registration, codec, handler — and a test of any one of them leaves the other two
 * able to be wrong in a way nothing notices.
 *
 * <p>{@code PayloadTest} tests the codecs. {@code QuestSyncTest} tests the writer against the reader
 * by calling {@code acceptTree} and {@code acceptProgress} <i>directly</i> — which is a real test of
 * the serialisation and a test of nothing at all about the plumbing. Neither would notice a handler
 * that was wired to the wrong payload type, or a registration whose {@code onClient} pointed at the
 * wrong method, or a payload whose chunk header never reached the reassembler.
 *
 * <p>So this takes the handler <b>out of the registry</b> — {@code ArmatureNetwork.registrations()} is
 * public and each carries its own {@code onClient} — and feeds it a payload that has been encoded and
 * decoded through a real Minecraft buffer. That covers registration → codec → handler.
 *
 * <h2>What it still does not cover, stated plainly</h2>
 *
 * <p>The loader's transport. {@code ArmatureNetwork.install} is called by each loader's entry point,
 * and no loader is present in a test JVM — so the step from "the handler does the right thing" to
 * "the packet arrived at the handler" is the one claim here that rests on the loader's own registration
 * code, which is a dozen lines in each subproject and is not asserted. That needs a client.

        // every item id to a stack on arrival — so `BuiltInRegistries.ITEM` is read. Without the
        // bootstrap that class's own initialiser throws, and the failure is not local to this class.
        // Java makes a failed class initialisation permanent: `BuiltInRegistries` is poisoned for the
        // whole JVM, so every *other* test class that needs it fails too, with
        // `NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class ...BuiltInRegistries`.
        //
        // That is exactly what happened. This test was added without the bootstrap, and the run went
        // from 3 failures in 254 to 14 in 206 — three of them in QuestSyncTest, which had been
        // passing, and which does bootstrap. The count going *down* was the tell that whole classes
        // were failing at initialisation rather than individual tests failing, and the ordering was
        // arbitrary because it is whichever class the runner reaches first.
        //
        // So the rule is: a test class that can reach a registry bootstraps, whether or not it looks
