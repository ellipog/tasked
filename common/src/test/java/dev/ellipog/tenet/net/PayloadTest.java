/**
 * The payloads: their ids, and whether they survive a round trip.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists, specifically</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a wrong payload id <b>crashed a real server on startup</b>, and nothing in the build
 * noticed. The code was:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * CustomPacketPayload.createType(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("tenet", "quest_sync").toString())
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>which reads as though it names the payload {@code tenet:quest_sync}. It does not.
 * {@code createType} is {@code new Type(ResourceLocation.withDefaultNamespace(name))} — it takes a
 * <i>path</i> and hardcodes the {@code minecraft} namespace. So the location became
 * {@code minecraft:tenet:quest_sync}, and the colon left inside the path threw from a static
 * initialiser:
 *
 * <pre>Non [a-z0-9/._-] character in path of location: minecraft:tenet:quest_sync</pre>
 *
 * <p>The failure was a single line in a server log after a 40-second boot. This test finds it in the
 * build in milliseconds, and it keeps finding it — the namespace assertion below is written over
 * <i>every</i> declared payload rather than the three that exist today, so the fourth one cannot
 * reintroduce the same mistake.
 *
 * <h2>The round trip is the other half</h2>
 *
 * <p>A codec with its fields in the wrong order compiles, registers, and then mangles every packet
 * it ever sends — which shows up as a client showing the wrong quest count, or a disconnect, or
 * nothing at all. Encoding and decoding an instance through a real Minecraft buffer catches it
 * without a server.
 *
 * <p>One thing makes that possible without a running game: {@code RegistryAccess.EMPTY}. None of
 * these codecs touch a registry — they are all {@code ByteBufCodecs} primitives over
 * {@code ByteBuf} — so an empty registry access is enough to construct the buffer the codecs expect.
