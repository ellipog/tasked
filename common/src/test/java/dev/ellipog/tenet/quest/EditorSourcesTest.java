/**
 * Which registry each {@link EditorField.Source} reads, and whether a real client has it.
 *
 * <h2>The rule, and why it is a check rather than a sentence</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A list may only be read from a registry the client is sent.</b> The structure picker broke it and
 * nobody noticed for a release, because breaking it does not fail anything: a registry a client was never
 * sent answers an <i>empty</i> one, so the picker simply opened with no rows. A rule whose only enforcement
 * is a running game is a rule that gets broken again, so the rule is checked here against 1.21.1's own
 * sets rather than against a list of ids somebody typed:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the registries the game builds at startup: {@code BuiltInRegistries.REGISTRY};</li>
 *   <li>the datapack registries a server sends a joining client:
 *       {@code RegistrySynchronization.NETWORKABLE_REGISTRIES}, which is
 *       {@code RegistryDataLoader.SYNCHRONIZED_REGISTRIES} -- in 1.21.1, the biomes, chat types, trim
 *       patterns and materials, wolf and painting variants, dimension types, damage types, banner
 *       patterns, enchantments and jukebox songs, and <b>nothing else</b>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Everything a datapack defines beyond that list -- a structure, a structure set, a placed feature, a
 * level stem -- is the server's, so a source that names one must be a source the server's own list
 * answers, and {@link EditorSources#registryFor} answers {@code null} for exactly those. The predicate is
 * decisive rather than approximate: no datapack registry appears in {@code BuiltInRegistries.REGISTRY} at
 * all, not even as an empty stub, so pointing {@code STRUCTURE} back at {@code Registries.STRUCTURE} fails
 * this file immediately. That re-pointing is the calibration.
 *
 * <h2>Why it can run without a client</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the table is in {@link EditorSources}, which names no client type -- the same promise
 * {@link EditorField} and {@link EditorSpecs} make. {@code SearchCatalogue} needs a running game to
 * gather a list; none of these questions does.
