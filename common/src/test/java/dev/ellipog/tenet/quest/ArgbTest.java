/**
 * The colour vocabulary a quest file's elements are written in.
 *
 * <h2>Why this has its own file rather than a case in the element test</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the rule is written twice, on purpose, and this is where the two copies are held together.
 * {@code Argb} cannot call {@link Colour#fromHex} — that class is the client's, and this model is read by
 * a dedicated server that must not load a UI class — so the rule exists in two places, split by the
 * boundary the rest of this format already draws. The last test in this file is what keeps the split from
 * becoming a drift: it runs every spelling both accept and both refuse through <i>both</i> readers.
 *
 * <p>The rest is the vocabulary itself, including the half that is easy to get wrong: a number, which is
 * how FTB Quests writes a colour and therefore how a converted pack arrives.
