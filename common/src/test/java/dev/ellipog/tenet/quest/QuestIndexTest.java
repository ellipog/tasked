/**
 * The cross-file checks: identifiers, dependencies, and where quests sit.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are separate from the validator's tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because they answer a different question. {@code QuestValidator} decides whether one file is
 * well-formed; this decides whether a <i>set</i> of files makes sense together — whether an id is
 * taken, whether a {@code dependsOn} resolves, whether two quests are drawn on top of each other. A
 * single file cannot answer any of those, which is why an author finds out about them at load rather
 * than at save.
 *
 * <h2>The test that matters most here</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Crowding#closeTogetherInARowWarn}. That check was added because a screenshot showed three
 * quest titles interleaved into what looked like a corrupt string, and the cause was a questline
 * authored 64 pixels apart with titles about 90 pixels wide. The client now copes with that — it
 * truncates to the measured room and drops a label that would sit over a node — but a layout that
 * hides what the author wrote is worth reporting at load, and a check with no test is a check that
 * quietly stops working.

     * and the first is the important one — a mod that installs example chapters into every
     * player's config directory has decided something that is not its to decide, and the first thing a
     * pack author would have to do is delete somebody else's content.
     *
     * <p>The second is smaller and still real: a quest file in the jar is a file that has to keep
     * working forever against a format that is still moving, and every format change is a migration
     * for content nobody asked for.
     *
     * <p>So they are authoring documentation in the repository, and
     * {@code tenet/tools/seed_quests.py} is what copies them somewhere. An author reads them; a
     * player never sees them unless they ask, which is the whole difference.
     *
     * <p>Relative to the Gradle project directory, which is {@code tenet/common} — the same place the
     * old path was relative to, so the tests run from the same working directory either way.

    /**
     * Loads the worked examples the way the mod does: copy them into a config directory, then run the
     * real loader over it.
     *
     * <h2>Why this goes through the loader rather than decoding the files itself</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because the examples are now a <b>folder tree</b>, and the only thing that knows how to turn a
     * folder tree into a questline is the loader. This used to build a {@link LoadedQuestFile} per file
     * by hand, which worked because version 1 puts one whole tree in one document — so "decode the
     * file" and "load the questline" were the same act, and a test was free to do the first directly.
     * Under version 2 they are not the same act at all: {@code group.json} decodes to a manifest holding
     * a list of <i>names</i> and nothing else, so a test that stopped at the codec would be asserting
     * about a tree with no chapters in it.
     *
     * <p>That is the same trap the seeding step had, one level up, and it fails silently in the same
     * direction: a manifest decodes perfectly and contributes nothing, so a test looping over the
     * examples would find every file, decode every one, and then assert about an empty questline.
     *
     * <h2>So it is the real path, including validation</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@link QuestLoader#load} parses, validates, decodes and indexes — every step the game runs.
     * These tests therefore now check something they could not before: that the shipped examples pass
     * the <b>validator</b>, not merely the codecs. That is strictly stronger, and it is why
     * {@link #bootVanilla()} sits at the top of this class: the validator resolves item ids against
     * {@code BuiltInRegistries.ITEM}, and an unbootstrapped registry does not report everything missing
     * — it throws from inside a vanilla class initialiser.
     *
     * <h2>The copy is not incidental</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@code QuestLoader} reads a directory and writes nothing, so a test that wants it to load
     * something has to put it there. That is exactly what {@code tenet/tools/seed_quests.py} does for a
     * player and what this does for a test. Copying rather than reading in place also keeps the
     * examples directory itself untouched, so no test can leave the repository dirty.
     *
     * <h2>Paths are preserved, and the underscore rule applies to every segment</h2>
     *
     * <p>The relative path is kept rather than flattened, because the layout <i>is</i> the format: a
     * quest called {@code punch_a_tree.json} at the quest root is not a quest at all, it is a version-1
     * file the loader will try to read as a whole tree.
     *
     * <p>And {@code _}-prefixed names are skipped at every segment, not just the last. The shipped
     * {@code _schema} folder is a <b>directory</b>, so a rule that tested only a file's own name would
     * copy all three schema files into the config directory — where the loader's own walk would then
     * skip them, so the mistake would be invisible from the test and visible only as three stray files
     * in somebody's install.
     *
     * @param configDir where to build the copy. Each caller passes a directory of its own, so two tests
     *     cannot collide over one config directory — and so a failed load cannot leave state behind for
     *     the next one.
