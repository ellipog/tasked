/**
 * Which tasks the tick registers by itself, and which wait for the player to press Submit.
 *
 * <h2>The rule, and the two faults it is made of</h2>
 *
 * <p>A task that <b>takes</b> what it asks for is handed over by hand: {@code tasks.md} promises that
 * "a task that takes something waits for the player to press Submit, because the press is the consent
 * to take it", and {@code XpTask}'s own note says the same about experience. Everything else is
 * registered the moment the count is met, which is what makes a presence-only item task complete by
 * itself.
 *
 * <p>Both halves were broken, in opposite directions. The tick took for every satisfied task that
 * answered {@code takesResources}, so experience and fluid vanished the moment a player happened to be
 * carrying enough — no press, no consent. And an item task that said nothing about consuming answered
 * {@code consumeItems().orElse(false)} to the button question while answering the chapter's default to
 * the take, so a chapter with {@code defaultConsumeItems: true} took the items while the row insisted
 * nothing was taken.
 *
 * <p>So this asserts the rule through {@code TaskTypes.behaviourOf}, which is the only door the engine
 * uses: a test that built the behaviour directly would prove the class right and the wrapper silent.
