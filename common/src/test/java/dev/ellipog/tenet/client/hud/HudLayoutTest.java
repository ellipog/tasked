/**
 * The HUD editor's arithmetic, over a sweep of window sizes.
 *
 * <h2>Why these properties</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because each of them is a way an editor goes wrong without saying so, and none can be seen in a
 * screenshot taken at one window size:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an element must be somewhere on the window at every size, however it was dragged or however the file
 *       was hand-edited -- a control at a coordinate from a larger window is a control that has vanished;</li>
 *   <li>the rows panel must be on the window and its rows must not overlap each other, which is the fault
 *       that reads as a rendering glitch rather than a layout one;</li>
 *   <li>and the default position of every element must be on the window at the smallest size a client can
 *       have, because a default is what somebody sees before they have moved anything.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>And the drag's own arithmetic, which is the fourth: it is the pointer less the grab the press took, so
 * it cannot drift. The rule that was there — the element's position plus the frame's rounded mouse movement
 * — is written out longhand below as the thing this is not, because that gap is invisible in one screenshot
 * and grows all drag long.
 *
 * <p>The windows swept are the ones a client can actually have: 176x120 GUI pixels at the smallest -- a
 * window narrower and shorter than any container panel -- up to 1920x1080.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately not asserted here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing about where an element is <i>relative to a panel</i>. An earlier version of this class did:
 * positions were offsets from the inventory panel's corner so the button travelled with the panel when the
 * recipe book slid it across the window. That made the editor draw a ghost of a panel it did not have, with
 * a corner that was not the real panel's corner, and the two spaces disagreed -- so the anchor went, and with
 * it every test about it. A window position is the whole of the model now.
