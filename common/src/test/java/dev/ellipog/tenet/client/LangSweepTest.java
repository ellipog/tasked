/**
 * The translation keys and the code, held in step in both directions.
 *
 * <h2>What is swept</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code SWEPT} names the namespaces this sweep has converted — the player-facing screen strings,
 * status lines, state words, the command read-outs, the notices, and the editor's own
 * {@code tenet.dev.*}, which was converted last. Every key there must exist in {@code en_us}
 * <b>and</b> be referenced by code, so an orphan and a missing key both fail.
 *
 * <p>The editor's namespace is reached the second way: a layout record holds the key and the draw
 * site resolves it, so {@code literalsThatAreKeys} reads those records rather than a
 * {@code translatable(...)} call. Converting a surface is adding its prefix to {@code SWEPT}, and the
 * note in TESTING.md says which are in.
 *
 * <p>Keys are found by scanning the sources for {@code translatable(...)} and
 * {@code translatableWithFallback(...)} with a literal first argument. That is a scan of <b>keys</b>,
 * not of prose: a key is a machine name in one known call shape, while a scan for English literals
 * would be blind to layout records and noisy on glyphs — which is why the reverse direction is
 * scoped rather than global.
