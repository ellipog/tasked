/**
 * A renderer that keeps what it was told to draw.
 *
 * <h2>Why the panel needs one</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because every fault this panel has had was a <b>drawing</b> fault that no arithmetic could see: the
 * radius row's arrows built as widgets at the list's coordinates and placed outside the panel; then drawn by
 * nobody at all; then a row that fell through the panel's dispatch into the switch-label branch and drew as a
 * bare label with no controls, while the hit test answered presses perfectly. Three reports from play, and the
 * question behind each of them is one line: <i>was anything drawn here?</i> A recorded call answers it. A
 * screen cannot be instantiated by a test; the panel can, and this is the part of {@link GuiRenderer} it needs
 * to be instantiated with.
 *
 * <p>No window, no font, no items. Text width is a stand-in — six pixels a character, which is what
 * Minecraft's own font is within a few tenths, and the arithmetic under test is position rather than
 * typesetting. The three methods that need a client answer "no" rather than throwing, so a test may draw a
 * panel that happens to contain an item or a player head.
