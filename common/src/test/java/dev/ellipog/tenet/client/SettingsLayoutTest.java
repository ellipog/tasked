/**
 * The settings card's composition, without a screen.
 *
 * <p>The card is <b>the player's own view and nothing about the pack's</b>: how large the text draws, and
 * where their HUD things sit. The look belongs to the pack and lives in the tools panel, and Motion is a
 * switch in that same panel -- so the test below that these are <i>not</i> rows is the point rather than an
 * omission.
 *
 * <p>It was written with one row and asserted that there was one, "adding another is a decision, not a
 * convenience". The HUD row is that decision: a placed button is the second thing on this card that is about
 * the player's screen rather than the book's appearance, and the count moved with the reason written down.
