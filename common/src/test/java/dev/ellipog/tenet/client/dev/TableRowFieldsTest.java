/**
 * What a folded entry offers, for every reward type this build registers.
 *
 * <h2>The fault this file exists for, and why it walks the registry</h2>
 *
 * <p>An entry's fold had two cases: an item, and a nested table. Every other type — experience,
 * command, advancement, stage, custom — folded onto eighteen pixels of nothing, so those fields could
 * not be set from the table editor at all. The fields existed, the loader read them and the grant obeyed
 * them; only the panel could not reach them, and nothing failed loudly, which is why it survived.
 *
 * <p>A hand-written switch per type is what the panel wanted — each type's fields are genuinely
 * different, and a generic form drew an item's count in the same shape as a command's permission level.
 * The price of hand-writing it is that the next field added to a type is a field somebody has to
 * remember to draw. So these tests do not check a list of controls against a written-out expectation:
 * they walk {@link RewardTypes} and ask whether every field it declares has somewhere to be edited.
 * That is the drift guard the hand-written switch needs.
