/**
 * A {@link GuiRenderer} that records what it was asked to draw instead of drawing it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is the second implementation, and why that matters more than it looks</h2>
 *
 * <p>The plan's reason for scheduling the seam last was fair and worth answering directly: <i>"an
 * interface wrapping one implementation is an indirection nobody can evaluate"</i>. A seam whose only
 * implementation forwards to the thing it abstracts is a layer of indirection with nothing on the
 * other side, and nothing about it can be tested — you cannot tell a correct forwarding from a wrong
 * one without a client, which is the situation the seam was supposed to improve.
 *
 * <p>This is the answer. It is not a renderer; it is a <b>reader</b>. Every call it receives is
 * recorded as a value, so a test can ask what would have been drawn without a window, a font or an
 * item registry — and the questions that become askable are the ones that were previously only
 * answerable by looking at a screenshot:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Does a hovered node draw an outline that follows its shape rather than a box around it?</li>
 *   <li>Is a label's backdrop behind the label, and is the label inside the node it names?</li>
 *   <li>Does an outline's four fills actually enclose the rectangle they claim to?</li>
 *   <li>Is a clip opened and closed exactly once, even on the path that returns early?</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That is what turns this from a deferral into work the tests hold. It also makes the seam
 * itself evaluable: a forwarding bug — {@code fill} passing its arguments in the wrong order, say —
 * is a failing assertion rather than a picture somebody has to notice.
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately does not simulate</h2>
 *
 * <p>No font metrics and no item rendering. {@link #textWidth} returns a fixed width per character and
 * {@link #icon} always reports success, because a test that needs real metrics is a test that needs a
 * client and there is no point pretending otherwise. What it records is the <i>sequence and geometry
 * of calls</i>, which is the part that is about this code rather than about Minecraft's renderer.
 *
 * <p>{@link #withCharWidth} exists so a caller can reason about wrapping and truncation with
 * arithmetic it chose, the same way {@code Measure.monospace} works for the layout tests.
