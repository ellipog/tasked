 * The fluid carried in containers — tanks, capsules, canisters — beyond plain buckets.

 * (a thousand millibuckets a bucket, empties handed back), which is vanilla behaviour no loader
 * may vary. This seam is everything else that holds fluid, read through the loader's own
 * machinery — NeoForge's fluid-handler capability, Fabric's Transfer API — because vanilla has
 * no container API to read it with.
 *
 * <p>The bucket item travels as a parameter so the two halves cannot count it twice: a filled
 * bucket is both a bucket and, on some loaders, a fluid handler. The loader skips stacks of
 * exactly that item and measures everything else.
