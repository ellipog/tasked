/**
 * What is inside a docked column — the header band, the body, the footer — and the four decisions that
 * are arithmetic rather than drawing.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class rather than a handful of sums in the screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>For the reason {@code BookGeometry} and {@code ToolsLayout} exist: the screen cannot be built by a
 * test, so anything about <i>where</i> a thing goes has to live where a test can reach it. The column's
 * outer rectangle is {@code BookGeometry}'s; everything inside it is here, and {@code PanelLayoutTest}
 * sweeps the whole of it at four sizes rather than at the one a person happened to look at.
 *
 * <h2>The three bands are the card's own numbers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #BODY_INSET}, {@link #BODY_TOP} and {@link #BODY_BOTTOM} are the figures a centred card
 * used to be drawn with. They are repeated here on purpose and the screen reads them from here: the round
 * that moved every kind into a rail promised that <b>the content does not move relative to its own
 * surface</b>, and that promise is only keepable if the rail measures the numbers the card did. A second
 * copy in the screen would be a second answer to "where does the body start", which is the class of fault
 * {@code BookGeometry} was written to end.
 *
 * <h2>The four decisions</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Fold</b>: whether a second column is shown, or paged into the first. Space decides unless the
 *       player has said otherwise ({@link #folded}).</li>
 *   <li><b>Which column carries the fold control</b>: the outermost one — the second when there are two,
 *       the only one when folded — because that is the column the press is about.</li>
 *   <li><b>The reveal</b>: how much of a column is on screen while it arrives ({@link #revealed}).</li>
 *   <li><b>The canvas's visible edge</b>: the leftmost column's inner edge, so a caller can keep the
 *       quest a reader just clicked out from under it ({@link #visibleRight}).</li>
 * </ul>

     * <p>The first version of this asked only whether the two columns fitted inside the canvas, and a

     * and its two floating clusters need to be worth showing.
     *
     * <p><b>The consequence is deliberate and worth stating:</b> a reader's book is capped at
     * {@code MAX_PANEL_WIDTH} (800), so its canvas is at most 644 — and two columns plus a minimum canvas
     * need 782. <b>A reader therefore never sees two columns; they always fold.</b> That is right rather

     * wins" means. This floor is about two of them at once.
     *
