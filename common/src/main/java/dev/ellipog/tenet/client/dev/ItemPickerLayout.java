/**
 * The item picker's arithmetic: which rows exist, how tall the list is, and where a pointer lands.
 *
 * <h2>One derivation for the drawing and the press</h2>
 *
 * <p>A row drawn at one rectangle and hit at another is a row an author cannot press, and the failure
 * reads as a broken mouse rather than as arithmetic. So the rows are composed here, their heights
 * decided here, and {@code rowRect} is the one answer both the drawing and the hit test read.
 *
 * <p>The list's scroll is the caller's, and it is one object's: every method here takes the offset it
 * is drawing at, and {@link #contentHeight} is what the caller's viewport is told — so the clamp, the
 * grip's travel and the rows' positions all come from the same number rather than from three
 * expressions that agree until one of them is edited. A class that also remembered the scroll would be
 * a second place the screen's state lives.

     * a press on those three pixels belonged to the row, and there was nothing for a drag to start on.

     * ({@code AssetsLayout.rows}/{@code scrollbar}) and the sidebar reserved before either
     * ({@code BookGeometry.SIDEBAR_SCROLLBAR}). Stating it in the <i>layout</i> is the only place it can
     * be stated and still be true of the row rectangles, the clip, the hit test and the bar at once.

     * clearance between it and the last character of a row.
