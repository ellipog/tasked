/**
 * Where the HUD editor's parts go: the rows panel, and every element's box.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class and not arithmetic in the screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a screen cannot be asked a question. {@code HudEditScreen} needs a live client to exist, so
 * "a dragged element is always somewhere on the window" and "the rows do not overlap each other" are facts
 * nothing could check if they lived in its methods -- and they are exactly the facts that go wrong silently,
 * as a control drawn one row too low or an element left half off the window. Integers and rectangles here
 * are asserted over a sweep of window sizes by {@code HudLayoutTest}, and the screen <b>builds itself from
 * them</b>: every rectangle drawn, hit-tested and dragged comes from one of these methods, so the test and
 * the screen cannot be describing two different layouts. That is the rule the book's own geometry was
 * extracted for.
 *
 * <h2>One coordinate space</h2>
 *
 * <p>An element's position is its position in the window, which is where the HUD is measured from too. The
 * rows panel is chrome the game never sees, so it is kept out of the way -- anchored to the bottom-left,
 * with its own height following how many elements there are -- and nothing converts between the two: a
 * position the editor writes is a position the game draws at, at any window size, which is the property
 * that was missing when a stored offset was measured from a ghost panel the editor had invented.
