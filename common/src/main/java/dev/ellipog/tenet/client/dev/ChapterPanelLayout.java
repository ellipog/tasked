/**
 * The Chapter tab's rows, from the chapter's own file.
 *
 * <p>The chapter is a file like a quest is, and this is the same inspector over it: identity, rules, and
 * the quest list in its authored order. Row keys are the dotted paths the commits go to, exactly as the
 * quest panel's are -- {@code EditorOp.SetChapter} is the op on the other end.
 *
 * <p>The quest list is shown in order, and it reorders: the rows drag, on the same gesture the card's
 * tasks and rewards use -- one drag for every list, as the note here said it would be. For a LINEAR
 * chapter the order <i>is</i> the progression, so the list is the thing being edited and not a summary
 * of it.
 *
 * <h2>Labels are short on purpose, and the rows stack</h2>
 *
 * <p>The dock is a narrow column, and this tab draws its labelled rows {@link
 * dev.ellipog.armature.client.ui.inspect.InspectLayout.Mode#STACKED}: the label on its own line, the
 * control across the whole width beneath it. That is what lets "Default Prerequisite Mode" fit at all --
 * as a side-by-side row in a 180-pixel panel it truncated to "Default Prereq...", which is the report
 * this shape answers. The names stay the file's own ({@code defaultPrerequisiteMode} is still the key);
 * only the words on screen are shortened to what the column can hold.
