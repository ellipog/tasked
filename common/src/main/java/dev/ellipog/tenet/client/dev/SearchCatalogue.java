/**
 * What a search field offers: the things the game actually has, resolved on the client.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a field that is an id -- a dimension, a biome, a statistic -- used to be a text box you had
 * to know the answer to. Everything here is a list the client already holds: the registries the game
 * ships statically, the datapack registries the server sends, the advancement tree, the custom
 * statistics, and the two lists the server sends because a client cannot build them.
 *
 * <h2>The one rule, which is in the table rather than in this class</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A list may only be read from a registry the client is sent.</b> A registry the server does not
 * send answers <i>empty</i> rather than throwing, so reading one is not an error, it is a picker that
 * opens with no rows and no explanation -- which is exactly how the structure list shipped, because a
 * structure is worldgen data the server keeps to itself. {@link EditorSources#registryFor} is the table
 * that names the registry behind every source, and {@code EditorSourcesTest} asserts each of them against
 * 1.21.1's own sets. This class only gathers what that table points at.
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * <p>It does not pretend to know more than it does. A datapack's dimensions and every structure are not on
 * the client -- one is level data and the other is a registry the server does not send -- so those two
 * lists come from the server, and a datapack dimension or structure added by a reload arrives on the next
 * join rather than mid-session. The dimension list falls back to the three every player knows before the
 * server has said; the structure list has no fallback, because a structure's id is the pack's to choose
 * and a list of vanilla ids would be a guess dressed as an answer. The picker's search box takes a typed
 * id either way, which is what keeps an empty list from being a dead end.
 *
 * <p>Labels come from the ids, prettified: a biome's own translated name is not reachable from a registry
 * key without resolving the biome's display, and an id a person can read ("The nether") is what a picker
 * row needs. The raw id is beside it as small print, where the picker puts it for every row.
