/**
 * The seam the book points back through: "show me how this is made".
 *
 * <h2>The other direction, and why it needs its own seam</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Integrations} carries quests into a viewer. This carries a click the other way: a player
 * reads a task or a reward, presses its row, and the chosen viewer opens on the recipes that produce
 * what the row names. The book cannot call a viewer itself — a viewer's packages may appear in one
 * file each, and the book names none of them — so the chosen adapter installs one of these, and the
 * book holds only the neutral type.
 *
 * <h2>One installs, and it is the adapter that already won</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each adapter installs only after {@link Viewers#mayInstall} says it is the one registering, so
 * the same priority chain that decides which viewer draws quest pages decides which one answers a
 * row press. With no viewer installed nothing is installed here, and every call is a no-op — the
 * book's click path must not be the one place a soft dependency becomes hard.
 *
 * <h2>Tags are part of the vocabulary, and not every viewer has them</h2>
 *
 * <p>A task can ask for a tag rather than an item, and "what do I even deliver" is the question the
 * press exists to answer, so a tag is a target rather than something the caller flattens into one
 * arbitrary member. Whether a viewer can open one is its own answer: {@link Lookup#supportsTags()}
 * is how the book knows to keep the press inert, and the hint hidden, when it cannot.
