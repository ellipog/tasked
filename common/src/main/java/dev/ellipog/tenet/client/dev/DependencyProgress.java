/**
 * How far a quest is from its prerequisites: what the rule asks for, and what has been met.
 *
 * <h2>Why the client needs this at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the canvas and the card both have to answer "is this prerequisite satisfied", and the
 * answer is <b>not</b> "is it completed". Two of the four modes count a dependency that is merely
 * started, so a client that asked about completion drew a satisfied prerequisite as unmet — a line that
 * stayed dark and a card row that showed a cross, for a quest a player could already unlock. The rule
 * fields cross the wire for exactly this, and this class is the one place they are turned into an
 * answer.
 *
 * <p>It is game-free on purpose: the screen cannot be instantiated by a test, so the arithmetic — the
 * bar a dependency must reach, how many are enough, which ones are still missing — lives here where a
 * test can hold it, and the screen asks.
