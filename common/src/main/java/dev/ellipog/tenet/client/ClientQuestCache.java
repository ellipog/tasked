/**
 * What the client knows about the questline, without a server.
 *
 * <h2>Why the client does not just read the quest files itself</h2>
 *
 * <p>It has them on disk. In a single-player world it could parse them directly and it would work. On
 * a multiplayer server it would not — the client has whatever files <i>it</i> has, which may be none,
 * may be an older version, and on a server running a datapack is guaranteed to be the wrong one. Even
 * in single player, a client reading its own copy would be judging itself against a different snapshot
 * from the server's.
 *
 * <p>So the server is the only authority, and this is a projection of what it said.
 *
 * <h2>Everything here runs on the client thread</h2>
 *
 * <p>Written from a payload handler, read from a screen, and both of those are the client thread —
 * that is where the loaders deliver payloads. So no synchronisation is needed and adding any would be
 * a lie about a contention that does not exist. The volatile fields are for the one moment that is
 * genuinely cross-thread: a disconnect clearing the whole thing.

     * from the authored defaults, which is right rather than unfortunate: a reload means the files
     * changed, and the authored state is the honest one for a tree nobody has seen.
     *
     * <p>So the unit is "a tree arrived", not "the tree is different". Comparing contents would answer
     * the same question a second way with its own answer for an identical re-send, and the two
     * descriptions would disagree about whether the player keeps their toggles — with neither being
