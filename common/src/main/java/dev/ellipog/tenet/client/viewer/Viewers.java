/**
 * Which recipe viewer, if more than one is installed, gets to draw the quest pages.
 *
 * <h2>One registers, and it is the first one in this list</h2>
 *
 * <p>A player can run two viewers at once, and two sets of the same quest entries is worse than one
 * set in the lesser viewer. So the rule is priority, not suppression: EMI carries the full
 * integration, JEI and REI carry the shared fallback, and each adapter asks
 * {@link #mayInstall} before it registers anything. The loser registers nothing at all -- not a
 * category with its recipes filtered out, which is the same duplicate with extra steps.
 *
 * <p>The order is the enum's declaration order, which is why the enum is declared in the order it is
 * and why the comment on it says so. Adding a viewer means adding it in the right place, and that is
 * a decision a reviewer can see in one line.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@code choose} takes a predicate</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same reason a provider chooser takes its candidates: the decision is the feature,
 * and it cannot be tested by installing three mods. {@link #chosen()} is the two-line runtime path
 * over the same call, so the tested thing and the used thing are one function.
