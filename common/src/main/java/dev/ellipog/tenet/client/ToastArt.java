/**
 * How one notice is drawn: the row, its box, its fade and its truncated sentence.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class rather than a loop in each drawer</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because there are two drawers now and they agree about everything except <b>where</b> the stack is.
 * The book stands its notices on the window's bottom edge, centred, where the eye already is when the hand
 * is on the canvas; the HUD's notice element draws them where the player put it. The box, the fill, the
 * alpha and the truncation are one description, and this is it -- the same rule the toolkit's control table
 * exists for, one subject over. Two copies of this arithmetic is exactly what the last several rounds kept
 * finding and deleting.
 *
 * <h2>Why the width is the caller's</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the two callers answer "how wide" differently, and each answer is right for its surface: the
 * book takes a quarter of its panel, which is a share of the surface it is drawn on, while the HUD element
 * is a placed thing and has to fit its own sentences. So the two bounds live here and the arithmetic
 * between them is the caller's.
