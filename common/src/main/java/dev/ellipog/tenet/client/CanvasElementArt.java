/**
 * How one canvas element is drawn: a picture, a label, a line or a box.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class, like {@code QuestNodeArt}</h2>
 *
 * <p>For the reason that class's own note gives, one level down: the canvas is a screen no test can
 * instantiate, so drawing that lives in it is drawing nothing can assert. Everything here takes a
 * {@link Frame} — a renderer and the four lookups this cannot answer for itself — which means a recording
 * renderer can be handed the same calls a client would get, and "a turned picture is wrapped in a turn",
 * "a box is two fills in this order" and "a shadowed label asked the seam for a shadow, at its own size"
 * become assertions rather than screenshots.
 *
 * <h2>What the caller decides and what this decides</h2>
 *
 * <p>The caller decides <i>whether</i>: which elements exist, which of them a reader may see, and where the
 * canvas is looking. This decides <i>how</i>: the box, the turn, the tint, the route, the ink. The four
 * things it cannot know arrive in the frame — the renderer, the viewport, a way to resolve a translatable
 * word, and a way to ask how far a quest has got — so nothing here reaches for a client singleton, and a
 * test answers all four with a constant.
 *
 * <p><b>The renderer is in the frame rather than passed beside it</b> for a reason that shows up in one arm
 * only: a label's box is its measured text, and measuring text is the font's answer rather than arithmetic
 * about a string. A class that guessed at it — six pixels a character — would place a hit box that disagrees
 * with the ink at every scale but one, and the disagreement would read as a label you cannot click.
 *
 * <h2>Decorations, and the one thing they are not</h2>
 *
 * <p>An element is drawn <b>under</b> the dependency lines and the quest nodes, which is the caller's
 * arrangement rather than this class's — and it is what makes a box a container for a cluster of quests
 * instead of a lid over them. Nothing here reads or changes a player's progress: {@code requires} asks how
 * far a quest has got and nothing else, which is the whole of the relation between a decoration and the
 * questline.

     * exactly where it was <b>on the canvas</b>. So the size is taken from the pointer measured <i>from that
     * anchor</i> and expressed in the picture's frame — not from the pointer's position inside the local box,
     * which would leave the dragged corner lagging half of every size change behind the pointer, because the
     * anchor is what is fixed and the pivot moves as the box grows. The box is then placed by solving for
     * where its origin must be for the anchor to land back on the point it started at.
