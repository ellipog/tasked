/**
 * The HUD editor: the list of movable things, and the things themselves, in one screen over the live world.
 *
 * <h2>Why it draws no background</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the point is to move something you can see. A screen draws over the world <i>and</i> over the
 * HUD -- {@code GameRenderer} renders the HUD on every frame in a world, screens or not -- so every
 * {@code Screen} that fills its background hides exactly what this one is for. {@link ArmatureScreen}
 * already suppresses that (no blur, no panorama, no menu texture) for its own reasons, and this is the first
 * screen that needs the world behind it rather than merely tolerating it.
 *
 * <h2>Two ways in, one place things are stored</h2>
 *
 * <p>Opened by its own key, or from the book's settings card -- with the book waiting to come back, because
 * a player who went through the book to get here did not ask to be dropped into the world when they were
 * finished. Every change writes straight to {@link HudSettings}, there is no Apply, and the
 * inventory-screen button reads the same numbers, so the editor and the thing it edits cannot disagree
 * about where something is.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing stands in for anything</h2>
 *
 * <p>The elements are drawn where they really are, at their real size, in the window's own pixels -- the same
 * space the HUD is measured in and the same space a stored position means. An earlier version drew a ghost
 * of the inventory panel so that a button anchored to that panel's corner had a corner to be anchored to;
 * the ghost's corner was not the real panel's corner, so a number written from one was read from the other
 * and the control moved between the editor and the game. There is one coordinate space now, and no stand-in.
 *
 * <p>Except the one this screen draws when the button is inventory-anchored: an outline of the closed-book
 * survival panel, from the same centring the game uses. An offset needs a corner to be read against, and
 * the editor has no inventory open -- so the ghost is the corner, drawn from {@code InventoryPanel} rather
 * than invented beside it, which is what makes a drop on the outline land on the real panel. It is a guide
 * under the chrome and the previews, never a hit target, and it stands down whenever the button is back in
 * the window frame.
 *
 * <h2>Moving things: drag, and the arrows for the last pixel</h2>
 *
 * <p>Grab the element and drag it; the drop writes where the widget's corner is, clamped onto the window.
 * A press on an element selects it, and the arrows then nudge it a pixel -- ten with Shift -- through the
 * same clamp, for placing something exactly where a drag overshoots by one. There used to be a {@code Move}
 * button that carried the element on the pointer, and it went away because everything here is already
 * grabbable: a second way to move is a second thing to learn, and the arrows cover the precision case the
 * button was really for.
 *
 * <h2>What is drawn over what, and which of the two answers wins</h2>
 *
 * <p>The rows' panel and labels are the bottom layer, drawn by this screen; the elements are widgets on top
 * of them; and the rows' controls -- a switch, <i>Reset</i>, <i>Done</i> -- are widgets added
 * <b>before</b> the elements. Both halves of that are deliberate, and they are the opposite of each other,
 * because a press is offered to children in the order they were added while drawing goes the other way:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the controls are asked first, so an element left lying across one cannot make it unreachable. An
 *       unreachable control is the one arrangement that traps a player in this screen;</li>
 *   <li>and so an element left lying across a control is drawn <i>over</i> it. It looks covered and still
 *       answers, which is the better of the two faults -- dragging it by any visible part moves it, and
 *       putting it down anywhere the rows are not is a release away.</li>
 * </ul>
