/**
 * A tick counter for the client, without naming a client class.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not {@code Minecraft.getInstance().gui.getGuiTicks()}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because {@code Minecraft} is a client class and this package is loaded on both sides — a
 * dedicated server has no {@code Minecraft}, and naming it in a class the server loads is the exact
 * mistake the client/server split in this project exists to prevent. So the counter is owned here and
 * advanced by the loader's client entry point, which is a class only a client loads.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>Counting a cooldown down on the client. The server sends "this quest has 600 ticks left"; the
 * client needs to subtract however many ticks have passed since, and for that it needs to know how
 * many ticks have passed. One number, incremented once per client tick.
 *
 * <p>It advances whether or not a world is loaded, which is fine — the only consumer is a screen, and
 * a screen with no quest data shows nothing regardless of what the counter says.
