/**
 * What the tools panel looks like: the preview, the list, and the band that edits one colour.
 *
 * <h2>Why the drawing is its own class</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because {@code QuestBookScreen} is a screen: nothing in it can be instantiated by a test, and it is
 * already the largest file in either mod. Everything here takes a {@link GuiRenderer} and plain numbers,
 * so the panel's appearance is one file that can be read at once — and the arithmetic it reads is
 * {@link ToolsLayout}'s, which is asserted.
 *
 * <h2>The preview, and what it is honest about</h2>
 *
 * <p>It draws one sample per tab: the graph's surfaces (a canvas, nodes, a card, a button, a tooltip, a
 * scrollbar mark) on the chapter tab, and the book's own chrome (panel, header, sidebar row, control,
 * scrollbar) on the book tab — see {@link ToolsLayout.Sample}. Selecting a colour rings the region its
 * <b>group</b> paints — eight regions for eight groups — because that is the question the list raises:
 * not "what is {@code rowHover}" but "which part of this screen does it change".
 *
 * <p>It is a <b>sample, not the book</b>: the proportions are its own, the text is literal, and the node is
 * always the rounded shape. A preview that claimed to be the real screen would be a second description of
 * it, and this one says what it is.
