/**
 * Whether a chapter is a row at all, for the person looking at the book.
 *
 * <h2>Two rules, and the second one is the interesting one</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A chapter with nothing to show is not a row.</b> That is the base rule, and it covers three
 * cases that a reader cannot tell apart and should not have to: a chapter whose quests are all still
 * hidden behind their own prerequisites, a chapter whose every quest is an easter egg nobody has
 * stumbled onto, and a chapter that holds no quests at all — one between being created and having its
 * first file written. In each case the sidebar row would be a door into an empty canvas, and a book
 * that lists those reads as a book with missing content rather than as one that is holding something
 * back. What "visible" means for a quest is {@link QuestVisibility}'s, and it is asked here rather than
 * answered again: this class only aggregates it.
 *
 * <p><b>A chapter whose own gate is unmet is a row only if its author did not ask otherwise.</b> That
 * flag is {@code hideUntilDependenciesComplete} on the chapter, and it is deliberately <i>not</i> the
 * same as the rule above: by default a gated chapter is listed and drawn dimmed, with what it is
 * waiting for on hover, because a map that shows a closed road is more use than one that omits it. The
 * author may withhold the row instead.
 *
 * <h2>What this is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not the gate. A chapter hidden here is still gated by the engine, and a chapter shown here is
 * still refused to a player whose gate is unmet: this decides what a screen draws and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Not the whole rule either, because an <b>author</b> sees every chapter — a row that vanished
 * while its content was still being written is a row that cannot be edited. That is the same split
 * {@code questsIn} makes for quests, and it is a parameter here rather than a caller's business so the
 * whole rule is assertable in one place.
 *
 * <p>Game-free on purpose, like {@link QuestVisibility}: the screen cannot be instantiated by a test,
 * and "a chapter with fifty quests, none of them visible, is not listed" is exactly the kind of rule
 * that would otherwise only ever be checked by looking at a book.
