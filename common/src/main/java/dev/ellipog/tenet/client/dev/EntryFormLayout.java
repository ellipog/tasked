/**
 * One card entry's form: its badge, its labelled fields, and the two controls in its corner.
 *
 * <h2>Why this replaced a flow layout</h2>
 *
 * <p>An entry used to be a flat list of boxes flowed left to right at fixed widths, with the label drawn
 * <i>inside</i> each box as placeholder text. That is why it read as a wall: a box said "Count" when it was
 * empty and "8" when it was not, a flag was a box containing the word "off", six coordinates were six
 * identical boxes, and nothing lined up with anything because every kind had a different width.
 *
 * <p>A form instead. Every entry opens with a badge -- the type's icon and the type's own name, which is
 * what makes a task a *named thing* rather than a sprite jammed against a box -- and then one field per
 * line (two, when both are narrow), each drawn as a label in a fixed column and a control in the column
 * beside it. Controls of a kind are the same size wherever they appear, so the eye can run down the
 * column.
 *
 * <h2>One derivation, again</h2>
 *
 * <p>Drawing and hit-testing both ask here, the house rule: a control drawn in one place and pressed in
 * another is the class of fault this codebase keeps designing out. The line count goes to
 * {@link OverlayLayout#entryRowHeight}, so the card's own arithmetic keeps placing the rows below against
 * the height the drawing will use.
 *
 * <p>Game-free: the editor's fields come from the registry, and nothing here touches a renderer.
