/**
 * Which quests this player has pinned to the HUD, and in what order: {@code config/tenet/pinned.json}.
 *
 * <h2>Its own file, and why not a corner of {@code hud.json}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code hud.json} is a <b>layout</b>: a diff from the defaults, one entry per element the player has
 * moved or switched, and a value put back to its default leaves the file. This is <b>content</b>: an ordered
 * list of quests, where "nothing here" and "here is where I put it" are different kinds of fact and an
 * empty list is a real answer rather than an absence. Mixing the two would give one file two shapes and one
 * reader two questions, which is the fault {@code HudSettings}'s own note about five files was written to
 * avoid -- so a pin list is a sixth area and gets its own file.
 *
 * <h2>The order is pin order, and every pin is drawn the same way</h2>
 *
 * <p>Pinning a quest puts it first, and the HUD draws the list top to bottom in that order -- each quest its
 * own box, with its own tasks. There is no focus and no front to bring forward to, so pinning something
 * already pinned changes nothing, and the book's menu offers Pin or Unpin and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>Why a stale id is harmless, and why it is pruned anyway</h2>
 *
 * <p>This file is per client and not per world, so a pin can name a quest the server being played does not
 * have -- or one a pack edit has since removed. Nothing breaks: the panel skips an id the tree does not
 * hold, and the skip does not spend one of {@link #MAX_PINS} drawn slots. But an unbounded list of dead ids
 * would grow for as long as somebody plays servers, so {@link #tick} drops them once per tree revision --
 * and <b>only</b> against a tree that is actually there, because an empty cache is a disconnect and pruning
 * against it would erase every pin on the way out of a world.
 *
 * <h2>Every way of being wrong</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same tolerance as the file beside it: a pin that is not a string, a blank one, a duplicate and a
 * "pins" that is not a list each cost what they should -- duplicates and blanks cost nothing, the others cost
 * the list -- while text that is not JSON at all costs the whole file, which is no pins. None of it stops
 * the client.
