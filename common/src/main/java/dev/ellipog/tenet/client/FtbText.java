/**
 * FTB Quests' text tokens, read at render time into segments.
 *
 * <h2>Why a parser, and why here rather than in the file format</h2>
 *
 * <p>Real pack text carries {@code &} colour/style codes, {@code &#RRGGBB} hex, {@code &z} rainbow,
 * an author-escaped {@code \&}, {@code {@pagebreak}}, {@code {image:...}}, {@code {open_url:...}},
 * {@code {substitute:...}}, and rarely a raw JSON text component. The quest schema does not change
 * for any of them: the converter passes pack text through verbatim, and this parser — applied after
 * the locale overlay has resolved, where the reader's prose is built — is what gives the tokens
 * meaning. A token nobody recognises stays literal text, because a description with one stray brace
 * in it should read as prose rather than as a parse error.
 *
 * <p>Game-free, like the prose rules it sits beside: a pure function of a string, asserted without
 * a client. Colour/style resolution stops here too — no Armature release — because the card already
 * draws one styled call per piece, so a prepass emitting coloured runs slots into the existing loop.
 * Two degradations are recorded rather than hidden: obfuscated ({@code &k}) has no run flag to land
 * on and arrives as plain, and rainbow ({@code &z}) is a static per-character gradient rather than
 * an animation, so it costs no repaint.
 *
 * <h2>Vanilla semantics for the vanilla codes</h2>
 *
 * <p>A colour code sets the ink and keeps the flags; a style code sets its flag and keeps the ink;
 * {@code &r} resets both. That is what {@code §} does in the game, and {@code &} is its author-side
 * spelling here — both markers, either letter case. A marker at the end of the string, or before a
 * character that is no code, is literal text: dropping it would eat words.
