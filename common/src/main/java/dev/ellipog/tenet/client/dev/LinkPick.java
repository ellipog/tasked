/**
 * A link-target pick in flight: the link being edited and the chapter holding it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is captured rather than read when the click lands</h2>
 *
 * <p>Arming a pick leaves the chapter tab open on the link, and the author is then free to switch to
 * another chapter to find the quest they mean — which is the whole reason a pick exists instead of a
 * text field. By the time the click lands, the chapter on screen may no longer hold the link, so the
 * link and the chapter the operation must be sent to travel with the pick, and the write goes to the
 * chapter that was being edited however far the sidebar has moved since. That is
 * {@link DependencyPick}'s own argument, and a target pick is the same gesture about one value
 * rather than a list.
 *
 * <h2>Why there are no refusals</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because any quest is a legal target: the loader's own check reports a name that resolves to
 * nothing, with the file and the line, so the pick needs no rules of its own. A dependency pick
 * refuses itself and its duplicates because those would break the progression; a link target
 * breaks nothing — the worst a wrong one does is mirror nothing, loudly.
