/**
 * The item picker's rules: what a query offers, in what order, and when the typed text is the answer.
 *
 * <h2>Why the rules are here and the registry is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>The screen supplies the entries -- the registry's items with their display names, and what the
 * player is carrying -- and this class decides everything a person could disagree with: the ranking,
 * the cap, and what Enter does. That split is what makes the rules testable without a client, which is
 * the same reason every other panel's arithmetic lives in a class like this one.
 *
 * <p>An entry's {@code count} is how many the player carries; zero means the list it came from is not
 * the inventory's. Nothing here reads a count -- the drawing says it -- but it travels with the entry
 * so the two sections cannot be built with different ideas of what a row is.
