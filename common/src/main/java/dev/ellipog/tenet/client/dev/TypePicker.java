/**
 * The type picker's catalogue: what can be added, in the order an author learns it, and what a query
 * makes of it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class rather than the screen's own loop</h2>
 *
 * <p>For the reason {@link ItemPicker} and {@link TableBrowserLayout} are: the questions here are
 * answerable without a client — which group a type is listed under, what order two matches come in, what
 * a blank search box shows — and a screen cannot be asked any of them. The screen supplies the entries
 * (the registries and whether a table will take each one) and the drawing; this decides everything a
 * person could disagree with.
 *
 * <h2>Why the catalogue arrives as entries rather than as rows</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the catalogue's *shape* — a heading, then the types under it — is the screen's, made of
 * {@code InspectRow}s that a panel draws, and this class must not know about that drawing. An
 * {@link Entry} is a type, its group, and the sentence a refusal carries; the rows this produces are
 * {@link ItemPickerLayout}'s, which is what makes the type list read like the item list.
 *
 * <h2>The three decisions</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A blank box lists everything, in catalogue order.</b> That order is the tables' — the groups
 *       an author sees when they first open the page — and a list that reordered itself as you learn it
 *       would be a list you cannot learn. The item picker shows only what you carry until you type, and
 *       the difference is deliberate: there is no "carried" half of a list of types.</li>
 *   <li><b>A query ranks id before name and drops the group headings.</b> Matches are answers rather
 *       than a page, so the headings that make the page readable would only break the ranking up. This
 *       is the item picker's own rule, from {@link ItemPicker#rank}, reused rather than restated.</li>
 *   <li><b>A group's name is not a search term.</b> The alternative is a second ranking with a third
 *       thing to match, and what an author types here is a type's name or its id.</li>
 * </ul>
