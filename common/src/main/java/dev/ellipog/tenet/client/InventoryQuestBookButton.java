/**
 * The quest book's other door: a control over container screens, in the window's top-left corner.
 *
 * <h2>Where it is</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two pixels in from the window's corner, which is where it ships and where {@link HudSettings} keeps it
 * until a player moves it in the HUD editor. That corner is contested by the recipe viewers -- JEI lays its
 * bookmarks out across the strip left of a container panel, and EMI's default left sidebar is its favourites
 * page -- and the answer to that is the editor and the switch rather than a different corner: a player can
 * put the button anywhere or turn it off, and it is worth having somewhere easy to find.
 *
 * <p>A player who puts it by the inventory rather than in the corner can anchor it to the panel instead of
 * the window, from the button's own row in the HUD editor. A window pixel that is "under the inventory" at
 * one GUI scale stops being under it at the next, because the panel is centred and moves with the window;
 * an offset from the panel's own corner survives that, because the live corner is re-added every time the
 * button is placed -- an inventory open, a resize, the editor's next frame -- including when the recipe
 * book slides the panel across the window. Window is the default and stays it; inventory is the opt-in.
 *
 * <p>It is offered on every container screen -- the player's own inventory in survival <b>and</b> in
 * creative, chests, crafting, furnaces, modded interfaces and anything else built on
 * {@code AbstractContainerScreen}, which is the same set of screens EMI and JEI draw beside. An inventory
 * is where a player looks for what is theirs, and a chest they opened for ten seconds is where they look
 * next: a door that only opens from one room is a door half the pack never finds. An inventory
 * anchor is resolved against the inventory panel's live corner on the two inventory screens, and
 * against the open container's own live panel everywhere else -- read through the screen's fields,
 * so an uncentred panel still reads correctly. An offset parked above or below the inventory keeps
 * its gap outside a taller chest instead of being swallowed by it, and likewise left and right of
 * a wider panel; inside, it tracks the corner the way a slot does. When the panel cannot be read
 * the closed-book ghost the HUD editor drops against keeps the button's place.
 *
 * <h2>Why it acts on press</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a container screen never delivers a release to its widgets: {@code AbstractContainerScreen}
 * overrides {@code mouseReleased} and {@code mouseDragged} without calling {@code super}, so the release that
 * {@link ArmatureButton} acts on never arrives, and a control wired the usual way would look alive and do
 * nothing. Acting on press is also what vanilla's own container-screen buttons do -- {@code onClick} is a
 * press callback -- so this is the ordinary behaviour rather than a workaround, and it needs no release, no
 * clock and no state that could get stuck.
 *
 * <p>Opening the book is the whole action. There is nothing to close first: replacing the screen
 * closes the menu it replaced -- an inventory close tells the server nothing, a container close tells
 * it through the screen's own removal -- and a stack on the cursor stays on the cursor. The book's key
 * does exactly this, and has since the book existed.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is placed once and not every frame</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because there is nothing for it to follow. The position is a window coordinate -- or an offset from
 * the panel's live corner, when the player anchored it to the inventory -- and the widget is rebuilt
 * from it whenever a screen initialises, which both loaders do on a resize; and {@link HudLayout} clamps it
 * into the window it is given. That is why this class has no per-frame drawing hook and no place on the seam
 * list: it reads a position, it opens a screen on a press, and it draws itself through the base class like
 * every other control.
