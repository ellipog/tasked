/**
 * The visibility family: whether a quest is drawn, and which parts of its card are readable.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class, with its own interface</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every rule here is a boolean function of things the client already knows — the quest's flags, its
 * dependencies, the team's progress — and none of it needs a screen. The screen cannot be instantiated
 * by a test; this can. So the rules live here and are asserted directly, and the canvas and the card only
 * ask the two questions this class answers. The alternative is what the codebase has already paid for
 * once: behaviour that exists only inside a drawing method, so the only way to test it is to look at a
 * screenshot and hope the flag that was set is the flag being read.
 *
 * <h2>The two families, kept apart</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code invisible} and {@code invisibleUntilTasks} are about the quest <b>existing</b> yet: it is
 * drawn when it is completed, or — with a task count — once that many of its tasks have progress. That
 * second half is the easter-egg case: a quest nobody can see until they have stumbled onto part of it.
 *
 * <p>The {@code hideUntil...} flags are about the quest being <b>revealed by its prerequisites</b>:
 * hidden until the prerequisite rule is met, or until at least one prerequisite is itself visible. The
 * second is recursive, which is what makes a chain of hidden quests reveal itself one link at a time.
 *
 * <p>A completed quest is always visible and always readable. That is not a special case bolted on: it
 * is what makes the flags safe to author, because nothing can be permanently lost behind one — the quest
 * that completes is the quest that shows itself, whatever the flags say.
