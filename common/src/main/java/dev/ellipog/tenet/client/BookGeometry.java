/**
 * Where everything on the quest book screen goes — and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a separate class with no Minecraft in it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the bug that produced it could not be tested. Two controls were drawn on top of each
 * other in the bottom-right corner, and the cause was that "near the bottom right" had been written
 * <b>twice</b>, as two expressions that were equal only by coincidence:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Open: canvasRight() - 78,               canvasBottom() + 11
 * Done: panelLeft() + panelWidth() - 68,  panelTop() + panelHeight() - 24
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code canvasRight() == panelLeft() + panelWidth()}, so the two x values were ten pixels apart
 * and the two y values about fifteen. The fix was to compute each shared position once — but that
 * fix lived inside {@code QuestBookScreen}, which extends {@code Screen} and needs a running
 * Minecraft to instantiate. So the property "these controls do not overlap" was still not testable,
 * and a future edit to those private helpers would have re-broken it with nothing to notice.
 *
 * <p>This class holds only that arithmetic: rectangles, and integers. No {@code GuiGraphics}, no
 * {@code Minecraft}, no rendering. It loads and runs in a plain JVM, so
 * {@code BookGeometryTest} can assert the properties that matter —
 * <b>no two controls overlap, and every control is inside the surface it belongs to</b> — across a
 * sweep of window sizes. That is a test of the exact failure that was reported.
 *
 * <h2>The shape of the screen, and what changed</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * +--------------------------------------------------------------+
 * | Quest Book                       20 quests . 100%      [ x ] |  header, close at the right

 * |             |          (the graph, the whole canvas)         |
 * +-------------+------------------------------------------------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Two things moved, and each replaced something that was spending space without earning it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The sidebar footer is gone.</b> It held four controls across two rows — zoom in, zoom out,
 *       re-centre and Done — in 116 pixels of a 132-pixel column. They are map controls, so they now
 *       sit on the map, as small square icon buttons in the canvas's top-left corner. That is where a
 *       player looks for them, it costs the chapter list no room at all, and it frees both footer
 *       rows.</li>
 *   <li><b>Done is now a close button in the header</b>, top-right, beside the quest count. A modal
 *       panel is closed by the thing in its corner, and the header had a mostly empty right end.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>And the summary strip is gone entirely</h2>
 *
 * <p>There used to be a third thing here: a bar across the bottom describing the selected quest with
 * an <b>Open</b> button. It went through two forms — a 46-pixel band reserved below the graph, then a
 * floating bar that appeared only when something was selected — and both were waste, for a reason
 * neither form addressed.
 *
 * <p><b>Clicking a node already opens the quest.</b> That is what a graph UI does, and the code has
 * done it since the pan/select/open gesture was written: a press that does not move selects
 * <i>and</i> opens, so the strip was a second route to a place you were already standing. A summary
 * of what you are looking at is only useful if you are not looking at it, and you just clicked it.
 *
 * <p>So the canvas is the whole area below the header, and there is nothing to keep clear of. That
 * also removes the class's only reason to distinguish a <i>canvas</i> from a <i>view port</i>: content
 * is centred in the canvas, because there is nothing on top of it.
 *
 * <h2>Screens are smaller than you think</h2>
 *
 * <p>Minecraft's GUI space is the window divided by the GUI scale, and an auto scale on a small
 * window gives remarkably little of it: the screenshot this was debugged from was
 * <b>427 × 240</b> GUI pixels. At that size the panel is 387 × 200. Anything that assumes 800 × 480
 * works on the developer's monitor and breaks on a laptop.
 *
 * <p>So the panel has a minimum size that can physically hold its own chrome, and below that minimum
 * the panel is allowed to run off the edge of the screen rather than overlapping itself. Off-screen is
 * clipped and obviously wrong; overlapping controls look like a rendering fault and are not obviously
 * anything.

     *
     * <h2>The sidebar term, re-derived</h2>
     *
     * <p>The sidebar needs the header, a gap, <b>one row</b> and the bottom edge:
     * {@code CHAPTER_GAP + SIDEBAR_ROW_HEIGHT + EDGE}. A list with no rows is a book whose only chapter
     * cannot be selected, which is a blank screen with no way forward.
     *
     * <p>What is guaranteed is now <i>weaker and more honest</i> than it was. It used to be "at least one
     * chapter fits above the bottom", measured by {@code chapterRows()} against a pitch — so the promise
     * was about the list being <b>complete</b>, and the arithmetic had to be right about how many rows
     * fit or the last one was drawn off the end. Now it is "the viewport is at least one row tall", and
     * everything past that scrolls. The consequences, both of them improvements:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>There is <b>no pitch in the term</b>, and no row count. The pitch is the Stack's (see
     *       {@link #SIDEBAR_ROW_HEIGHT} for where it went) and the count is the outline's, so this
     *       constant cannot be invalidated by a change to either. That is the pressure that has gone,
     *       and it is why this is a re-derivation rather than a renumbering.</li>
     *   <li>The number is <b>unchanged</b> at {@code 6 + 18 + 8 = 32}, because the first row's position
     *       and its height are the same as they were. It is worth saying plainly that the figure not
     *       moving is not evidence that nothing changed: the sum that produces it is a different sum
     *       describing a different guarantee, which is exactly the kind of coincidence that makes an
     *       unchanged test count reassuring and meaningless.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A third thing went out of this term too: it used to be measured to the <i>appearance rows'</i>
     * top, because those were anchored to the panel's bottom and a row counted past them would have been
     * drawn underneath. They are gone, and the list measures to the panel's edge now — see
     * {@link #sidebarViewport()}.
     *
     * <h2>The canvas term, re-derived</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@code (EDGE - VIEW_MAT) + (VIEW_COLUMN_HEIGHT + VIEW_MAT * 2) + EDGE}. It is the view cluster,
     * which is the tallest thing that sits <i>on</i> the canvas: three square buttons, the gaps between
     * them, and the mat that makes them read as one group, all inside the canvas's own {@link #EDGE}.
     * Without it the cluster runs past the bottom of a short canvas, which is the same class of fault as
     * a row drawn underneath a footer — a control outside the surface it belongs to, and therefore
     * clickable outside it.
     *
     * <p>This term is <b>arithmetically unchanged</b>, and unlike the sidebar's it is not a coincidence:
     * nothing about scrolling touches the canvas. Writing it out again is the point of the exercise
     * rather than a formality — a "re-derive both terms" that quietly copied one of them would not be a
     * check, and the useful half of this paragraph is that the canvas's term is the one that did not
     * move, for a reason that can be stated.
     *
     * <h2>The band, and the third term this constant gained</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@link #AUTHOR_BAND_HEIGHT} sits between the header and both of the terms above, because both
     * start below it: the sidebar's list and the canvas are the panel's body, and the band is chrome over
     * the top of it. So this is {@code HEADER_HEIGHT + AUTHOR_BAND_HEIGHT + max(sidebar, canvas)}, and the
     * band is paid for by both columns rather than one.
     *
     * <p>It is the same height whether or not the band is drawn, which is deliberate: the band belongs to
     * an operator, and an author's panel that was taller than a reader's at the same window would be two
     * geometries to test with one of them never seen until somebody was de-opped.
     *
     * <p>The numbers, for whoever needs them: the sidebar needs {@code 6 + 18 + 8 = 32} and the canvas
     * {@code (8 - 3) + (58 + 6) + 8} = <b>77</b>, so the canvas still decides the body;
     * {@link #AUTHOR_BAND_HEIGHT} is {@code 18 + 3 * 2} = 24 and {@link #HEADER_HEIGHT} is 26, which makes
     * {@code MIN_PANEL_HEIGHT} {@code 26 + 24 + 77 = 127}. Every figure is written in terms of the
     * constants the bands are drawn with, so changing {@link #VIEW_BUTTON} or {@link #ROW_HEIGHT} cannot
     * silently invalidate it.
     *
     * <p><b>The margin between the two body terms is the number to watch, and it is why both are written
     * out rather than one being carried.</b> The canvas asks for 77 and the sidebar for 32, so the column
     * has 45 pixels of room for another feature before it starts deciding the minimum. A band does not
     * spend it -- the band is above both terms rather than inside one -- and a reader who does not know the
     * margin exists finds out from a screenshot.

     * spare, because the dock and a docked column float there. The last {@code EDGE} is what the band used
     * to add on the far side of itself and no longer needs.

     * is the one position that cannot be a field. The arithmetic is still this class's, which is the point
     * — {@code BookGeometryTest} sweeps window sizes and widths together, and the width a drag writes is
     * the width the column draws at, because there is only one expression.
     *
     * <h2>The canvas is what it covers, and it never covers the sidebar</h2>
     *
     * <p>A column is anchored to the canvas's right edge and may cover the whole of it — that is what "the
     * panel wins" means — but the cap is the canvas less a {@link #PANEL_GAP} on each side, so it can
     * never reach the chapter list. Hiding the navigation to show a quest would be a trade nobody asked
     * for: the list is how the reader gets anywhere else.
     *
     * <p>At the cap the column is the canvas minus a hair on each side, which reads as a full-page panel
     * rather than as a slab pinned to one edge. A width of zero or less, or a canvas with no room at all,
     * gives a zero-width rectangle rather than a negative one: a caller drawing nothing is a caller whose

     *   <li><b>Bottom: the panel's own {@link #EDGE}.</b> Measured to the panel's edge, because there is
     *       nothing else below the list any more — see {@link #MIN_PANEL_HEIGHT} for the two appearance
     *       rows that used to be anchored there and the bug their anchoring caused.</li>

     * <p>This is the method the screen and the test share, and that sharing is the whole point. The
     * screen creates its widgets from these rectangles; the test asserts they do not overlap. A
     * layout change therefore cannot move a control without the test seeing it.
     *
     * <p>Note what is <b>not</b> here: nothing named for the footer that used to hold these, no control
     * at all whose only job is to close a panel that Escape already closes, and nothing for the summary
     * strip that used to sit across the bottom. Close is one square in the header, and the four former
     * footer controls are three map buttons and that square.
     *
     * <h2>The chapter rows used to be handed out from here, and they are not any more</h2>
     *
     * <p>This was {@code controls(int chapters)}, and it put {@code chapter0} … {@code chapterN} into the
     * map, capped at the number that fitted. The map now holds only the controls whose positions are
     * <b>fixed</b> — the header's close button and the three map buttons — and the argument that told it
     * how many chapters there are is gone with them.
     *
     * <p>The reason is worth stating precisely, because it is not "the rows moved elsewhere" but
     * "something else owns them now". A chapter row's position depends on the row's own index (its y),
     * on whether its group is collapsed (whether it is drawn at all), and on the scroll (how far it has
     * been moved) — and the last two of those are properties of a <i>view</i>, not of a layout. A map
     * built once from a size cannot express "row 5, currently scrolled out of view" without also
     * becoming the thing that decides it, which is what a {@code Stack}, a {@code Layout} and a
     * {@code ScrollView} already are.
     *
     * <p>So this method keeps the half of its job it can still do honestly — the fixed chrome — and
     * {@link #sidebarViewport()} says where the rows are allowed to go. What the overlap test sweeps
     * therefore shrinks to four controls, which is correct rather than a loss: those are the four that
     * can collide, and the rows cannot collide with each other because a Stack places them in a column
     * one after another.

    // whole round was about rather than tidiness.
    //
    // They were a second implementation of zoom-about-the-pointer. The first was in
    // QuestBookScreen itself, as three static fields and the same algebra written out twice more --
    // in the pan, in the centring. The transform is `ui.kit`'s `Viewport` now, which the screen
    // calls, and `ViewportTest.zoomAtKeepsTheContentPointUnderThePointer` asserts the same
    // invariant this copy's suite did -- swept over more pans and scales than it managed, and
    // asserted against the transform rather than against a re-derivation of it.
    //
    // So this copy had no callers. Nothing said so: it compiled, its tests passed, and a reader
    // would reasonably have taken it for the one the screen uses. That is the failure mode of a
    // duplicate — not that it is wrong, but that it is *plausible*, and it stays plausible after
    // the thing it duplicates has moved on.
