/**
 * How a quest node is drawn: one description, shared by the canvas and the settings preview.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class</h2>
 *
 * <p>The node's drawing used to be a private method of {@code QuestBookScreen}, which is a class no test
 * can instantiate and no preview can call. The settings page wants to draw the same node — a preview
 * that drew its own version would be a second description of the thing the author is choosing, and the
 * second description is always the one that drifts: the canvas would gain a wash and the preview would
 * not, or a shape would be added and the preview would keep drawing a square. That is the same fault
 * the tools panel's preview was built to avoid, one level up.
 *
 * <p>So the drawing takes a {@link GuiRenderer} and plain numbers, exactly like {@code QuestPanel} and
 * {@code ToolsPanel}, and both callers hand it the same {@link Look}.
 *
 * <h2>What the caller decides and what this decides</h2>
 *
 * <p>The caller decides <i>state</i>: which edge colour a node's progress gives it, how hovered it is,
 * whether it is selected. This decides <i>art</i>: the ring outside the panel, the panel in the shape,
 * the icon at its fitted box, the block that stands in when there is no icon, and the wash that dims a
 * finished or locked node. Those five steps are the whole of what a node looks like, and they are in
 * this order because each one is drawn over the last.

     * @param size       the node's drawn size in pixels
     * @param shape      the outline's <i>name</i>, which is what says whether a panel is drawn at all
     * @param geometry   the outline's geometry, <b>with any rotation already applied</b>. Resolved by
     *                   the caller rather than here, because a rotation is applied by sampling the shape
     *                   again and a node drawn per frame must not rebuild its table per frame
     * @param icon       the item drawn in the middle; null or empty for no item, which is what the
     *                   stand-in block is for. Null is accepted rather than required to be
     *                   {@code ItemStack.EMPTY} because the game-free tests cannot build a stack at all

     *                   to bootstrap — and "no item" is a real state a caller may want to draw.
     * @param texture    the texture path drawn in the middle when the icon is a texture, and empty
     *                   otherwise. A texture wins over the item: the two never arrive together, because
     *                   the cache resolves one arm and keeps the other's half empty. Drawn stretched into
     *                   the icon's box; a path nothing holds draws the game's missing texture, like an
     *                   image element's missing file.
     * @param sprite     the atlas region drawn in the middle when the icon is a sprite, and empty
     *                   otherwise. Drawn from the atlas after the texture arm is asked and before the
     *                   item arm: one picture wins, in the order the cache resolves, and a region
     *                   nothing holds draws the missing mark like an unheld file.
     * @param iconScale  how much of the node the icon is asked to fill; the outline caps it
     * @param alwaysIcons whether the icon is drawn whatever the box measures: the per-node
     *                   answer of a chapter or book that disabled the canvas LOD. False keeps
     *                   the box-size gate below, which is what every tiered chapter draws with

     * @param drawsPanel whether the panel is drawn at all — false for {@link QuestShape#NONE}, whose
     *                   node is its icon and whose geometry is still a square for the hit test
