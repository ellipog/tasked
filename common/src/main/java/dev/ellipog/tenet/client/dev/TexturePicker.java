/**
 * The texture picker's rules: which of a pack's files are offered, what a row is called, and which
 * rows exist for an id the pack does not hold.
 *
 * <h2>Why the catalogue is an argument and the rules are here</h2>
 *
 * <p>The screen owns the resource manager -- which files the client actually has is the game's answer,
 * read from {@code listResources("textures", ...)} -- and this class decides everything about those
 * files a person could disagree with: which one is a picture, what a row shows, and how a query ranks
 * them. That is the same split {@link ItemPicker} makes for items, and it is what lets the rules be
 * asserted without a client: a test hands in resource locations and reads rows back.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are entries and not a second record</h2>
 *
 * <p>A texture row and an item row are the same shape to the list: an id, a label and a string of small
 * print. Reusing {@link ItemPicker.Entry} means the ranking, the cap and the typed-missing rule are the
 * item picker's own, already tested, rather than a parallel copy that would drift. The two meanings of
 * {@code data} differ -- an item's custom data there, the namespace here -- and each picker is the only
 * reader of its own, so nothing has to reconcile them.
 *
 * <h2>Why the label drops the directory and the extension</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code textures/gui/button.png} is the id a file commit needs and a poor thing to read in a list:
 * every row would lead with the same word and end with the same four letters, which is exactly the part
 * that says nothing. The row shows {@code gui/button} and keeps the id in its own field, so a search
 * matches what the author reads while a pick still writes what the file needs.
