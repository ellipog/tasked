/**
 * What Normal mode hides: the one place the editor's depth is described.
 *
 * <h2>The two depths, and which flag owns them</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link DevMode#on()} asks whether a player may edit at all; {@link DevMode#advanced()} asks how much
 * of the editor to show. Normal is the default -- the basic set, so a first-time or occasional author meets
 * a page they can read -- and Advanced is everything, which is what the editor drew before this class
 * existed. This class is the only reader of the flag, so "what does Normal hide" is one answer in one file
 * rather than a question each panel answers for itself.
 *
 * <h2>Why the vocabulary is three sets and not one</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the same word means different things in two panels: {@code aliases} is a quest's extra ids on
 * the settings page and a chapter's on the chapter tab, and the chapter tab's rules are keyed by the same
 * field names the quest's own rules use ({@code minRequired}, {@code prerequisiteMode}). One set would hide
 * a control in a panel nobody asked about, so each vocabulary gets its own:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #fieldKeys()} -- a task's, a reward's or a condition's own field, by the path its form
 *       declares. Shared by the card's fields, the inspector's rows and a table entry's fold, because all
 *       three name the same field.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #rowKeys()} -- a row of the quest settings page that is not a whole section.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #hiddenSections()} -- a named section of the pack's Assets panel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Whole sections are gates, not keys, and the reason is nesting</h2>
 *
 * <p>A filter that dropped a section by its heading key would have to know where the section ends -- and a
 * section can hold headings of its own: the Colours section's rows come in groups, each with a heading, so
 * a cut that stopped at the next heading would let the colours back in on the far side of a group's name.
 * The row builders already have the right structure for this: every section is written inside its own block
 * ({@code if (!folded.contains(RULES))}, and its like), so a section Normal mode hides is one
 * {@code if (Advanced.on())} around the block that builds it. That is also the robust place rather than the
 * fragile one: a row added later inside a hidden section is hidden with it, where a set of keys would have
 * to be kept in step by hand for ever.
 *
 * <h2>What this class does not decide</h2>
 *
 * <p>It never changes a value, never closes a panel and never refuses an edit: a hidden field keeps what
 * the file says, and its value comes back with one press of the latch. <b>Hiding is unconditional</b> -- a
 * field is hidden whether or not the file names it -- because the alternative, showing the ones that are
 * set, would make what a page contains depend on the quest being looked at, and the cut would stop being
 * describable in one file. Nothing here runs on the server side either: a depth is what this client draws,
 * not what the pack contains.
 *
 * <p>The cut is asserted in both directions by {@code AdvancedTest}: every key in every set is produced by
 * a surface that really has it -- so a rename fails the build rather than quietly hiding nothing -- every
 * registered type keeps a field to fill in at the shallow depth, and no heading is left standing over the
 * rows a gate took away.

     * A task's, a reward's or a condition's own field, by the path its form declares.
     *
     * <h2>Why these, and not the ones that feel similar</h2>
     *
     * <p>Each of these is a refinement of a value the author has already given, or an escape hatch: the
     * cadence a task is re-checked at, how strictly a carried stack must match, whether only crafted items
     * count, one criterion of an advancement rather than the whole thing, the three filters a kill task can
     * carry, how long an observation has to last, the permission a reward's command runs at, and the ways a

     * the item, the count, the dimension, the target, the value.
     *
     * <p>So the rule for a new field is the one this list states: if it says <b>what</b>, it is basic; if it
     * says <b>how exactly</b>, it is Advanced. A field that is neither is a question for whoever adds it,
     * and this list is where the answer goes.
