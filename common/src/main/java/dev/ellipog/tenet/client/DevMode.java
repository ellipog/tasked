/**
 * This client's own preferences: whether tools may be drawn, and how the book prefers to be shaped.
 *
 * <h2>Why a mode rather than a set of buttons</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the quest book is content, and a theme picker is a tool. The two rows that used to sit at
 * the foot of the book's sidebar were removed in the theme round for exactly that reason, and this is
 * where they went: a pack author needs a mode, not a permanent set of controls on somebody else's
 * screen. FTB Quests has the same shape for the same reason.
 *
 * <h2>Why the flag is Tenet's rather than Armature's</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because what it gates is this mod's screens. Armature owns the things a tool *operates* -- the
 * appearance, the themes, the token registry, the file format -- and every one of those already exists
 * and is asserted. What did not exist was a place to put the controls, and the editor for quests that
 * will follow them is Tenet's, so the mode is Tenet's too. The argument that moved the picker *out*
 * of Armature's toolbox and into a setting applies in reverse here: a control wrapped around an
 * operation that already lives in the library can be moved without anything being rewritten.
 *
 * <h2>The file, and what happens when it is wrong</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code config/tenet/client.json}, a client preference beside Armature's own
 * {@code appearance.json}, and the same tolerance in the same places: a missing file is a first run and
 * is worth no words at all, and a file that exists and cannot be read is worth one that says where it
 * is. The mode flag defaults to off, because a mode that changes what a screen shows should never be on
 * because a file was unreadable. Beside it ride two on-by-default switches: the editor's snap, which
 * changes where a dragged node lands, and the sidebar's chapter progress bars, which change what a
 * chapter row shows. Both are the tidy direction, so a file that does not name them leaves them on.
 *
 * <h2>The panels' own settings, and the one that left</h2>
 *
 * <p>How wide each panel is and whether a child folds into its parent are the same kind of thing the two
 * switches above are: preferences about how this client draws, read before anything can draw it.
 * <b>Neither is gated on {@link #on()}</b>, which is the rule {@code snap} and {@code progress} already
 * follow and which is worth keeping: a player who never turns developer mode on still has a layout, and
 * it is theirs rather than the pack's.
 *
 * <p><b>There used to be a third: whether an overlay is a docked column or a centred card.</b> It is gone,
 * because the card is gone -- every kind occupies a rail now, including the reward question. The key is
 * still tolerated on read, exactly as any unknown key is: a file written when the switch existed must not
 * cost the player the settings beside it, and a value that no longer decides anything is safer ignored
 * than reported. Nothing writes it, so it disappears the first time any setting changes.
 *
 * <h2>One width per kind, because one width was two answers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code panelWidths} is a diff from the defaults rather than a full table: a kind the player has never
 * dragged has no entry, and a drag back to the default removes the entry it had. That is
 * {@code ThemeFiles}' own shape and its own reason -- a file that restates every value cannot be read for
 * what the player changed -- and it means the file grows only where somebody made a choice.
