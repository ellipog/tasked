/**
 * The two HUD elements' one drawing, and the notice stack that feeds one of them.
 *
 * <h2>Why one class rather than a painter per element</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the two questions a layout has to answer -- how big is this, and paint it -- have to be
 * answered by the same description, or the editor grabs a box the game does not draw. Both are
 * <b>exhaustive switches over {@link HudElement}</b>, so a fifth element fails to compile until it has an
 * answer to each; that is the shape {@code HudElement}'s own note said it was waiting for.
 *
 * <h2>Where this is called from, and what it is not allowed to name</h2>
 *
 * <p>The loaders' HUD seams -- Fabric's {@code HudRenderCallback}, NeoForge's {@code RenderGuiEvent.Post} --
 * each wrap the frame's drawing context in the toolkit's renderer and call {@link #render}. So this class
 * names no {@code net.minecraft.client} type and is safe to load on a server, where it is simply never
 * called. Nothing here is drawn on a server, and nothing here decides whether the HUD is drawn at all: the
 * seam is not called while the player has hidden the GUI, which is the answer F1 gets for free.
 *
 * <h2>The element's size is measured every frame, and nothing is cached</h2>
 *
 * <p>A pin list and a notice stack are as big as what they hold, so their size is asked for rather than
 * remembered. {@code size} and {@code paint} each assemble the content again rather than sharing one
 * assembly, and that is deliberate: the tree and the progress can both move between the two calls, so a
 * cached panel would be a frame of somebody else's pins -- and the walk is a handful of quests either way.
 *
 * <h2>The notice stack</h2>
 *
 * <p>One {@link ToastStack}, exactly as the book keeps one: same lifetime, same cap, same fade, and the
 * drawing is the same {@code ToastArt} the book uses. This class owns it because the HUD element is what
 * shows it, and {@link #notice} is the only way in -- {@code QuestNotifier} is the only caller, which is what
 * keeps "what happened" in one place and "where it is said" in another.
