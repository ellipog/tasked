/**
 * The one detector of completions, tasks, claims and chapters, and the client half that says so.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is exactly one</h2>
 *
 * <p>The book used to diff the cache itself, in its own {@code tick} — so a completion while the
 * book was closed was never noticed, and a notifier added beside it would have announced the same
 * completion twice whenever it was open. This class owns the diff ({@link QuestNotifications}) and
 * the book is a <b>sink</b>: it is asked to show the sentence, it does not decide that there is one.
 *
 * <h2>The three sinks, and why the routing is here</h2>
 *
 * <p>The book's own stack is the right notice while the book is on screen — chat is unreadable
 * behind a screen, and the stack is themed and tested. A player who is not looking at the book is
 * told the same sentence one of two ways: as a row on the HUD's own notice element, where they put
 * it, or — if they have switched that element off — as a real toast ({@link QuestToast}), which the
 * game draws over whatever they are doing. All three carry the same sentence, so they can never
 * disagree about what happened, and this method is the only place the three are chosen between.
 *
 * <h2>One ordered list, biggest news first</h2>
 *
 * <p>A claim-all, a party's shared progress or a counter finishing several tasks can move a dozen
 * things in one sample, and the cap means only the first few are told. So the notices are <b>ordered by
 * significance before the cap is applied</b>: a chapter finishing, then a quest finishing, then the tasks
 * that arrived. Ordered by id or by the cache's own walk, the one notice that matters most would be the one
 * a burst dropped. The cap itself is the book's stack's own number, so the two sinks bound a burst
 * identically.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle, which is where the interesting bugs are</h2>
 *
 * <p>The diff is reset on a disconnect (both loaders call {@link #reset()}) and whenever the team
 * changes or the cache empties — because a static notifier outlives a screen, and one that kept its
 * map across a world change would read the next server's tree against the previous server's states
 * and announce a completion that never happened. See {@link QuestNotifications#sample}.
