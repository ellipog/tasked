/**
 * How much of the canvas to draw, and from how far out — the client's own thresholds, in a file.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are a player's settings rather than the mod's constants</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the right answer depends on the machine and the eye, and neither is the mod's to know. A
 * player on a laptop wants a chapter to stop drawing rings sooner than one on a desktop; an author
 * photographing a canvas wants everything drawn at a zoom where a reader would rather see shapes. The
 * numbers were constants, which made the choice for both of them — and the first thing that went wrong with
 * them was visible in a screenshot: a <b>landmark node lost its icon</b> because a global zoom threshold
 * decided icons were smudges, while the node itself was enormous and had room to spare.
 *
 * <h2>The three values, and what each decides</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code iconMinBox}</b> — the smallest an item's box may be, in pixels, before the node stops
 *       drawing its item and draws its stand-in block instead. This one is <b>per node</b>, measured from
 *       that node's own outline, and it is why the zoom no longer decides whether an icon is drawn: a large
 *       node has a large icon at any zoom, and a small one runs out of room at a specific size rather than
 *       at a specific zoom. Default 12.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code ringsBelow}</b> — below this zoom, no hover or selection ring. Default 0.5.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code blocksBelow}</b> — below this zoom, no titles and no reward badges. Default 0.3.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Tolerant, and clamped, in that order</h2>
 *
 * <p>Like the other client files: a missing file is a first run and gets no message, a file that cannot be
 * read gets one and leaves the defaults in force, and an unknown field is ignored. On top of that the
 * numbers are <b>clamped</b>, because a threshold is a number whose wrong values are not errors but
 * nonsense: a zoom threshold of 5 would mean "never draw a ring" on a canvas that only zooms to 2.2, and a
 * blocks threshold above the rings threshold would mean a tier that can never be reached. So a value outside
 * its range takes the nearest end of it, and {@code blocksBelow} is held at or below {@code ringsBelow}.
 * Neither clamp is a guess at intent: both are the only readings under which the ladder means anything.
