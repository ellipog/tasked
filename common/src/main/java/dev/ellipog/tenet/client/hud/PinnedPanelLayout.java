/**
 * The pinned quests' arithmetic: one box per quest, how tall the stack is, and where each row sits.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class and not arithmetic in the painter</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a painted panel cannot be asked a question. The HUD is drawn by a renderer that needs a live
 * client, so "each quest is its own box", "every box shows its own tasks", "a long title is truncated
 * rather than allowed to widen the box off the window" and "the editor's empty sample is still a box you
 * can grab" are facts nothing could check if they lived in a draw call -- and every one of them goes wrong
 * silently, as boxes that merge into one slab or an element that cannot be picked up. Integers and strings
 * here are swept by {@code PinnedPanelLayoutTest}, and the painter <b>builds itself from them</b>: every
 * rectangle drawn comes from a row of this list, so the test and the drawing cannot be describing two
 * different panels. That is the rule {@code HudLayout} and the book's own geometry were extracted for.
 *
 * <h2>One box per quest, and why the focus model is gone</h2>
 *
 * <p>This used to be one panel with a head drawn in full and the rest as names. A surface that cannot be
 * clicked cannot have a focus worth bringing forward -- "Focus on HUD" was a second act for what "Pin to
 * HUD" already did -- so every pin is now drawn the same way: its name, its tasks, its counts. Re-pinning
 * something already pinned changes nothing, and the menu offers Pin or Unpin and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>The rows carry their own text, already cut to fit</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Row#text()} is what will be drawn, not what was authored: the truncation happens here, where the
 * box's width and the font are both known, so the painter has no measurement left to do and no opportunity
 * to disagree with the box the test asserted. The row is then a left-to-right sequence -- an icon, then its
 * text, then a count, then a tick -- and the drawing advances by measuring those same strings, which is the
 * one place a second opinion could have crept in.
 *
 * <h2>What it is given, and what it deliberately is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>Data, not the game: a list of {@link Pin}, assembled one layer up from {@code ClientQuestCache} by the
 * painter, and a {@link Measure} for the font. No {@code ItemStack}, no screen, no window -- so the whole of
 * the stack's shape is assertable headless, and the icon a task draws cannot change where its row is. The
 * task's <i>index within its own quest</i> travels on the row instead of its icon, which is what lets the
 * painter find the stack without this class ever holding one.
 *
 * <p>The <b>words</b> arrive resolved for the same reason the icon does not: this class has no business
 * knowing what language the player reads, and a sentence built here would be one a translator cannot reach.
 * The one exception is {@link Words#moreTasks}, a function rather than a string, because that sentence
 * carries a count nobody knows until the rows are laid out -- and a placeholder a translator can move is
 * better than a number glued into an English fragment.
