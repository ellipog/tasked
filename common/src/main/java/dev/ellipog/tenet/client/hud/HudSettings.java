/**
 * Where this client's HUD things are, and whether they are drawn: {@code config/tenet/hud.json}.
 *
 * <h2>Its own file, and the four it sits beside</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code appearance.json}, {@code client.json}, {@code canvas.json} and {@code working.json} already
 * exist, one per area of this client's own preferences. A layout is a fifth area and gets a fifth file --
 * rather than a corner of {@code client.json}, which is the tools' file and whose schema is the panel-width
 * table. What lives here is not a developer's setting: it is where a player put their things.
 *
 * <h2>A diff from the defaults, not a table</h2>
 *
 * <p>An element the player has never touched has <b>no entry</b>, and a value put back to its default is
 * removed from the entry it was in; an entry with nothing left in it goes. That is
 * {@code DevMode.panelWidths}' own shape, and its own reason: a file that restates every value cannot be read
 * for what the player changed, and a file that grows a line every time somebody drags something and puts it
 * back is a file nobody can diff.
 *
 * <h2>What a stored value is, and what it is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>A <b>position in the window's own pixels</b> -- the same space the HUD is measured in and the same space
 * the editor draws in, so a number written there is a number the game draws at, at any window size -- unless
 * the book's button is anchored to the inventory panel, in which case it is an <b>offset from the panel's
 * top-left corner</b>, re-based on the panel's live corner at every placement. Read
 * through the element's {@code Anchor}: a middle-anchored element's y is an offset from the window's
 * vertical centre rather than an absolute pixel, which is what lets its default of 0 mean "centred" on
 * every window without a constant naming a middle that moves.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here clamps it: the only bound that means anything is the window, and that is not known until
 * something is being drawn or dragged. A hand-edited {@code -500} is therefore kept exactly as it was
 * written and lands at the window's edge, rather than being rewritten to a number the player did not type.
 *
 * <h2>Every way of being wrong</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same tolerance as the file beside it, at the same granularity: a key that names no element this
 * build has, a value that is not an object, and a field of the wrong type each cost <b>that entry</b> -- the
 * element keeps its defaults and its neighbours are untouched -- while text that is not JSON at all costs the
 * whole file, which is the defaults. Neither stops the client.
