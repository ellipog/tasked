/**
 * One thing a player can place, drawn by whichever surface it belongs to.
 *
 * <h2>Why a table rather than a setting per thing</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because there are four of them and there will be more. The book's button appears over the player's
 * inventory; the pinned quests and the notices sit on the HUD. All of them want the same three answers -- is
 * it drawn, where is it, what does it default to -- and all of them want the same editor to change them.
 * Written per thing, that is a class each and the editor learns about each one; written as a table, the
 * editor walks {@link #values()} and a new element is one line here plus its own drawing.
 *
 * <h2>A position, in the window's own pixels</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #defaultX()} and {@link #defaultY()} are GUI pixels from the window's top-left corner, and that
 * is the same corner the HUD is measured from -- so what the editor shows is what the game draws, with no
 * conversion in between and nothing to get wrong at a second window size.
 *
 * <p><b>This replaced an offset from the container panel's corner, and the reason is worth keeping.</b> The
 * panel-anchored version had the book's button travel with the inventory panel when the recipe book slid it
 * across the window, which is what that anchor was for. But the editor has no panel to draw against, so it
 * had to invent one: a ghost of the inventory panel, centred in the editor's own canvas -- and two corners
 * that are not the same corner, with a stored number measured from each, is a control that jumps between the
 * editor and the game. The user-visible symptom was exactly that, and a straight position in one space
 * cannot have it.
 *
 * <p><b>The button can be measured from the panel again, as an opt-in {@link Origin}.</b> What broke the
 * first version was not the offset but the ghost: the editor's corner was invented while the game's was
 * centred, so no stored number could satisfy both. The ghost now draws from the same centring the game
 * uses (see {@code InventoryPanel}), so the two corners agree whenever the recipe book is closed -- and
 * when it is open the button follows the live panel, which is the behaviour the first version wanted.
 *
 * <h2>What a box here means, now that two of the four are not boxes</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #width()} and {@link #height()} are a <b>control's</b> real box and, for a drawn element, only
 * the size the editor falls back to before it has asked for the content's own. A pin list and a notice stack
 * are as tall as what they hold, so their live size comes from {@code HudOverlay}'s own measurement -- one
 * per frame, clamped against the window like every other position here. The distinction is {@link Kind},
 * and it is why the editor's preview no longer asks "is this the button" but "is this a control or drawn".
 *
 * <h2>Where the drawing lives, and why not here</h2>
 *
 * <p>A control draws itself -- the button is an {@code ArmatureButton} on somebody else's screen and knows
 * what it looks like -- while the two HUD elements are drawn by the HUD, which needs a renderer and a window
 * this enum has none of. So the drawing is {@code HudOverlay}'s, as one exhaustive switch per question (what
 * size, and paint), and a fifth element fails to compile until both answer for it. That is the shape this
 * table wanted all along: the note here used to say a drawing hook would wait for a second real caller, and
 * the HUD's own two are it.
