/**
 * Where the Assets panel's pieces are: the title, the section column, the page, the footer.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class rather than the screen's own sums</h2>
 *
 * <p>For the reason {@link TableEditorLayout} and {@link ChapterPanelLayout} are: every question worth
 * being wrong about here is arithmetic on integers — which section a press is on, where a list's rows
 * start, how tall a page's content is, which row a scroll position shows — and arithmetic on integers is
 * what this project's tests can hold without a client. The screen draws what this says and asks it what a
 * press means, so the rectangle a row is <i>drawn</i> at and the rectangle it is <i>hit-tested</i> at are
 * one derivation. That rule is written down because its absence is this panel's whole family of bugs.
 *
 * <h2>The shape</h2>
