/**
 * What one editing gesture costs on the server, by phase, once a second to the log.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists, and what it is a falsifier for</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code QuestLoader} already reports the <b>reload's</b> phase split — read+decode, assemble, index,
 * cycles, tables — and that is the tail of an edit. It is not the whole of one, and the part it cannot see
 * is the part that happens <b>per operation</b>: a field edit is applied, validated and written before any
 * reload is owed, and with a burst of them the per-op half is the whole story. Every number in
 * {@code report-editing-performance.md}'s latency table is arithmetic over measured file sizes precisely
 * because nothing counted this. So it is counted.
 *
 * <p>It is a <b>falsifier</b> in the same sense {@code QuestWalks} is: the claims it settles are of the
 * form "a burst's wall time is dominated by N fsyncs and N full-chapter validations", and the way to settle
 * one is to print the counts and the milliseconds.
 *
 * <h2>The phases, and why these five</h2>
 *
 * <p>They are the ones a decision can be made from, and they are separated because the remedies differ:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ops} — how many reached the editor. The denominator for everything else, and the number that
 *       says whether a "burst" is fifty or five.</li>
 *   <li>{@code applyMs} — {@code EditorOps.apply}, which is the model change <b>and</b> the save. One number
 *       rather than two because the save is not separable from here: {@code apply} calls it, and a second
 *       timer around a call it makes internally would be a second description of the same interval. What the
 *       save costs <i>on its own</i> is the thing {@code applyMs} is read against {@code ops} for — a mean
 *       that climbs with the chapter is the validation cost, and a mean that stays flat while {@code writes}
 *       climbs is the disk.</li>
 *   <li>{@code writes} — files actually written, counted at the write seam. One for a field edit, two for a
 *       create (the quest and the manifest).</li>
 *   <li>{@code syncs} — atomic writes, and therefore fsyncs: {@code JsonWrite.atomically} opens with
 *       {@code StandardOpenOption.SYNC}, so the two are the same event by construction rather than by
 *       agreement. The name says {@code syncs} rather than {@code fsyncs} because the option is what is
 *       being counted; if it ever stops being SYNC, this number stops meaning fsync and this is where that
 *       is written down.</li>
 *   <li>{@code flush} — the coalesced half: the reload, the index rebuild, the cycle pass, the tree encode
 *       and the deflate. Reported once per flush rather than accumulated per second, because a flush is an
 *       event with an identity and an average of five of them describes none.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Off, and what it costs when off</h2>
 *
 * <p>One branch per call, and the branch is on a static boolean. Every entry point below returns before it
 * reads a clock, looks anything up or allocates, so this can sit on the apply path without a second thought
 * about the instrument's own cost — the same contract {@code QuestWalks} keeps.
 *
 * <h2>The tally, and the thread it is written on</h2>
 *
 * <p>A plain map, because every caller is the server thread: the payload handler, the tick flush and the
 * save are all on it. There is no version of "the op was applied somewhere else" that would not also be a
 * bug worth a crash. The per-call allocation a {@code Map.merge} would make is avoided as well — the value
 * is a {@code long[]} so a call is a lookup and an add.
