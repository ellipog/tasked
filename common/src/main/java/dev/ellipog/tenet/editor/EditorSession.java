 * What the canvas remembers until the server's answer arrives: positions asked for and not yet seen.
 *
 * <h2>One exception with an expiry, and this is it</h2>
 *
 * <p>The canvas draws the tree the server sent, always — that is the whole of "the server is the authority".
 * The one thing that cannot wait for a round trip is a node the author has just dragged: the drop has to land
 * under the pointer rather than snap back for a tick and then move. So a position is remembered here, keyed by
 * quest, and forgotten the moment a tree arrives whose revision has moved — after which the files' own answer
 * is the current one and nothing is pending.
 *
 * <h2>What is no longer here</h2>
 *
 * <p>This held opened {@code QuestEditor}s as well, because the client used to edit chapters itself when it
 * was the host. It does not any more: the client sends operations and the server owns the files, so a client
 * on a dedicated server — where the files are not — has nothing to open. What is left is the pending
 * positions, which are a fact about this client's screen and nobody else's.

     * <p>Because {@code movedAtRevision} is the *tree's* revision, recorded beside the position — it does
     * not move while an author drags a node, which is exactly when these positions change fastest. A cache
     * keyed on the tree revision alone would therefore hand back a node's old position for the whole of a
     * drag. This is the honest signal for "ask again": it moves on every recorded position and on the
     * clear, and nothing else in the client has to know how the positions are stored.

     * <h2>Why the clear is wholesale, and why that is not the (0,0) fault</h2>
     *
     * <p>It was tempting to make this selective — to drop only the positions the arriving tree disagrees
     * with and keep the rest — and it is wrong, which is worth recording because it looks like a strict
     * improvement. <b>What is stored here is "the server has not answered yet"</b>, and a revision that
     * moves means it <i>has</i> answered. A position kept past that point is a position the tree has already
     * refuted, drawn over the top of the server's own answer: the author sees their node where they left it
     * while the file says otherwise, which is the one thing this class exists to prevent. It is not merely
     * conservative — {@code nodeX} falls back to {@code movedX} whenever an id is present, with no further
     * check, so a kept entry is drawn.
     *
     * <p>So the clear stays. The (0,0) write it contributed to is fixed where it belongs: the release that
     * commits a multi-node drag now asks {@link #hasMoved} before reading a position, instead of trusting
     * that every id it remembers still has one. That guard is the whole fix, and it is the read path's own
     * rule — see {@code QuestBookScreen.nodeX}, which has always guarded this way.
     *
     * <p>Called with the cache's revision, every frame, because that is where the fact lives: the tree
     * arriving is what makes the files' own answer the current one, and nothing else in this class can see it.
     * A revision that has not moved leaves them alone, which is what keeps a node where the author put it
     * while they are still working.
