/**
 * The quest lifecycle, as events other mods — and KubeJS scripts, through the integration — listen to.
 *
 * <h2>Why these six</h2>
 *
 * <p>The first four are the moments a pack author's code has an opinion about: a quest starting, a quest
 * completing, one task of it being satisfied, and a reward being handed over. FTB Quests' KubeJS
 * integration exposes the same four, and everything a script does with a quest is built from them. The
 * two stage events came with stages themselves: a stage is granted by a command, a reward or a script,
 * and the thing a script most often wants is to run something <i>when</i> it is granted rather than to
 * poll for it.
 *
 * <h2>Fired beside the write, in two places</h2>
 *
 * <p>The four progress events fire inside {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.progress.ProgressService}, and
 * {@link #STAGE_ADDED}/{@link #STAGE_REMOVED} fire in {@code StageService.add}/{@code remove} — beside
 * the store write and the sync, which is where that class's own note says they belong. Both are at
 * the moment the engine itself records the change, so an event cannot describe something that was
 * refused, and a listener runs before the caller's next statement. Listener exceptions are the listener's problem;
 * the engine does not catch them, because swallowing a script error would make a broken script look
 * like a quest that silently did nothing.
 *
 * <p>Loader-neutral, like Armature's own events: the same code fires on Fabric and NeoForge, and on
 * an integrated server, because all three run this class.
