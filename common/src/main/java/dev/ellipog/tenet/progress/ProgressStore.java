/**
 * Every team's quest progress, for one world.
 *
 * <h2>Keyed by team id, which is a player's UUID when they are alone</h2>
 *
 * <p>Armature gives a solo player a team whose id <b>is their own UUID</b> (see {@code Team.solo}).
 * That single decision makes this class simple: progress is always looked up by "the id of the team
 * you are in", with no branch for solo players and no second storage layout.
 *
 * <p>It also gives the right behaviour for free when somebody joins a party. A player's solo progress
 * sits under their UUID; the team they join has its own id and its own progress. Joining means they
 * now read the team's — and their own is untouched, waiting if they leave. FTB Quests behaves the
 * same way, and the alternative (merging, or importing) is a decision nobody can make well
 * automatically: a new member arriving with four hundred completed quests would hand the whole party
 * a finished questline.
 *
 * <h2>Leaving is the asymmetric half, and it is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * <p>What is refused on a join is done on a departure: {@code ProgressService.retainFor} merges the
 * party's record into the leaver's own, so quest nodes earned together are kept by whoever leaves and
 * a progression-gated pack cannot soft-lock somebody who goes solo. The party's record is not moved —
 * the members still in it read exactly what they did before — and nothing is imported the other way.
 * One direction would finish a questline for free; the other would erase one.
 *
 * <h2>Saved per world</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@link SavedData} on the overworld rather than per-dimension, so a quest finished in the
 * Nether counts. Marked dirty after every write; forgetting that produces progress that works all
 * session and is gone tomorrow, which is a miserable thing to be handed.
 *
 * <h2>Why the stages live here too, and why they are keyed by player</h2>
 *
 * <p>A stage is a named flag a player has, the thing a pack's scripts and quest gates ask about. It is
 * keyed by <b>player</b> UUID rather than by team, unlike everything else in this class, because that is
 * what a stage means everywhere it is used: GameStages, FTB Quests' stage integration and every pack
 * script written against them ask "does <i>this player</i> have it". A team-mode reward that grants a
 * stage grants it to the player who claimed, which is FTB Quests' behaviour too.
 *
 * <p>They share this file rather than getting one of their own so that a grant and the completion that
 * caused it are written, versioned and backed up together -- one world's quest data in one place.
