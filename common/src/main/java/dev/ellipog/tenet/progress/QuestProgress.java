/**
 * One team's progress through one quest.
 *
 * <h2>Task progress is keyed by position, and that is a real limitation</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code taskProgress} maps a task's index to how far along it is. Reordering the tasks in a quest
 * file therefore moves progress to a different task — insert a task at the top and every existing
 * progress value shifts down one.
 *
 * <p>Keyed this way anyway, because the alternative is worse. Giving every task an author-chosen id
 * means every task in every file needs an id, forever, and the files get noisier for a case that
 * almost never comes up. Keying by a hash of the task's content is worse still: editing a count
 * would silently orphan the progress.
 *
 * <p>What actually happens in practice is that reordering a quest's tasks resets partial progress in
 * that one quest, and the next time a player does anything the progress recomputes from their
 * inventory. Nothing is lost that was not derivable. The failure mode is mild enough to be worth the
 * simpler file — but it is a real trade, so it is written down rather than discovered.
 *
 * <h2>Progress is the team's; a payout is the player's</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code taskProgress} is team-wide, and {@link #claims} is where the per-player side lives: who
 * has collected which reward. See {@link QuestClaims} for the rule that decides whose claim a given
 * reward reads.
 *
 * <p>{@code rewardsClaimed} is not "everyone has collected everything" — that is not a fact a
 * per-player model can settle globally, and it would fight the repeatable quest that needs an answer.
 * It means <b>the completion round is over</b>: set when a repeatable quest's payout was collected
 * by the player who claimed it, and what {@code canComplete} reads before starting another round.
 * {@code legacySettled} is the migration-only cousin: a quest a pre-per-player build recorded as
 * collected reads as collected for everyone, so no old save can be paid twice.
 *
 * @param state           how far it has got
