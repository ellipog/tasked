/**
 * Works out which quests a team can do, and which it has done.
 *
 * <h2>It reads; it never writes</h2>
 *
 * <p>Everything here is a pure function of the loaded quests, a {@link TeamProgress} and the clock.
 * The state of every quest is <b>recomputed</b> rather than stored, which is deliberate: a stored
 * state can drift out of step with the files, and then a player is permanently locked out of a quest
 * whose dependency they have actually finished. Recomputing costs a walk over the graph, and this
 * graph is a few hundred nodes — a few microseconds, on a tick where anything changed at all.
 *
 * <p>The only thing persisted is what a player <i>did</i>: which tasks are satisfied, how many times a
 * quest was completed, and when. Those are facts that cannot be derived and must be stored. "Is this
 * unlocked" is not a fact — it is a conclusion, and conclusions are cheaper to draw again than to
 * keep in sync.
 *
 * <h2>Cycle safety</h2>
 *
 * <p>Dependencies can form a cycle, because a file can be edited into one. The loader reports it as
 * an error, and this resolves around it rather than hanging or overflowing: a quest already being
 * evaluated higher up the stack comes back LOCKED, so a cycle simply never unlocks. That is the
 * honest answer — no ordering of a cycle satisfies it — and it means a mistake in a quest file
 * produces a quest that cannot be completed plus a clear message at load time, rather than a server
 * that never finishes starting.
