/**
 * Who has collected which of a quest's rewards.
 *
 * <h2>Per player by default, per team on request</h2>
 *
 * <p>A reward that says nothing goes to whoever claims it, and <b>every member</b> may claim their
 * own copy: the quest's progress is the team's, the payout is not. A reward marked {@code team: true}
 * is the other arrangement — the first claim settles it for the whole team — which is what a pack
 * author reaches for when the reward is a one-per-party thing (a shared key, a claim block) rather
 * than a payout.
 *
 * <p>That is FTB Quests' model, and getting it wrong in the obvious direction — one claim per team
 * for everything — is the difference between a party of four each getting a diamond, and only the
 * first one to open the book getting one.
 *
 * <h2>Two maps, and neither is derivable from the other</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code team} holds indices settled for the team (team-mode claims, and the auto-claims that
 * completion made on the team's behalf); {@code players} holds, per player, the indices they have
 * collected. A team-mode index is in the first and in nobody's second — a player-mode index is in
 * whoever claimed it and never in the first. The reward's own {@code team} flag decides which map a
 * question reads; see {@link #claimed}.
