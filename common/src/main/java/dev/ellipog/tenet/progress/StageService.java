/**
 * Stages, as everything else asks about them: the command, the stage reward, a quest's gate, and -- once
 * the scripting integration is in -- a pack's scripts.
 *
 * <h2>One method per change, not three calls per site</h2>
 *
 * <p>Granting a stage is a write, a sync to that player's client and an event, and doing those three at
 * every call site is how they drift: a stage saved but not synced is a client script that disagrees with
 * the server, and a stage synced but not announced is a listener that never runs. So the three live here
 * together, and a caller asks for the change rather than assembling it.
 *
 * <p>The write is per player, which is what a stage means -- see {@link ProgressStore}'s note. A player who
 * is offline takes the write and skips the rest: a script may legitimately grant a stage to somebody who is
 * not here, and refusing that would be the worse half of the trade.
