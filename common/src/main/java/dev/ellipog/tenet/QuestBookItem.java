/**
 * The quest book.
 *
 * <p>Right-clicking opens the quest screen — but note what this class is <b>not</b> doing. It
 * is a common class: it runs on a dedicated server, where {@code net.minecraft.client} does
 * not exist. So it names no screen, no {@code Minecraft}, no {@code Screen}. It asks
 * {@link ArmatureClient} to open one <i>by id</i>, and the actual registry lives in a class
 * only a client ever loads.
 *
 * <p>The {@code isClientSide} guard is what keeps that call off the server. Without it, the
 * screen opener would be asked to open something that cannot exist there — harmless in this
 * particular case, which returns false, but the habit is what keeps a mod from crashing on a
 * server the first time something on this path really does need a client.
