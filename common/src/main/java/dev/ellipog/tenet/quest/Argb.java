/**
 * A colour in a quest file, and the one place the format says what one is.
 *
 * <h2>The vocabulary, which is the toolkit's and not this file's invention</h2>
 *
 * <p>A string of six or eight hex digits with an optional leading {@code #} — {@code #24242E} and
 * {@code #8024242E} — or a number, read as the same 32-bit pattern. Six digits means opaque, which is what
 * anyone writing a colour by hand types, and eight carries alpha, which a translucent wash needs. This is
 * exactly what {@code Colour.fromHex} accepts and what the {@code themePatch} schema documents, so an
 * author who has set a theme's colour already knows how to set a box's.
 *
 * <p><b>A number is read as a long and truncated, and both signs mean the same colour.</b>
 * {@code 16711680} is {@code #00FF0000}; {@code 4294901760} and {@code -65536} are both {@code #FFFF0000}.
 * That is not laxity for its own sake — the theme's own reader does the same, and FTB Quests writes a
 * colour with its high bit set as a <i>negative</i> number, so a converter that refused the negative half
 * would lose exactly the colours that carry an alpha.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not {@code Colour.fromHex}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because that class is the <b>client's</b>, and this one is read by a dedicated server that has no
 * business loading a UI class — the same boundary that makes {@link Chapter#themePatch} carry raw JSON
 * rather than a parsed patch. The rule is therefore written twice, in the two places the boundary puts it,
 * and <b>the agreement is checked rather than asserted</b>: {@code ArgbTest} compares this reader against
 * {@code Colour.fromHex} over the spellings both accept and both refuse, so the second copy cannot drift
 * from the first without failing the build.
 *
 * <h2>A value that is not a colour is an error here, and the validator is what says so readably</h2>
 *
 * <p>This is the shape every closed vocabulary in this format already has — {@link PrerequisiteMode},
 * {@link ProgressionMode}, {@link QuestShape} are all read by {@code Codecs.enumByName}, which refuses a
 * name it does not know. The reason it is safe is the order the loader works in: a chapter is <b>validated
 * first</b>, the validator reports the offending value at the field's own path with
 * {@link #spellings()} as its advice, and a file with an error on it is skipped — so the codec's own
 * refusal is never the first thing an author meets.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately <b>not</b> the {@code Codecs.clampedInt} treatment, and that difference is the one
 * that codec's javadoc draws: clamping is right where a number outside its range is a presentation
 * decision with a nearest sensible value, and wrong where "the number is the meaning". A colour that is
 * not a colour has no nearest one, so inventing transparent black for it would hide the mistake rather
 * than report it.
