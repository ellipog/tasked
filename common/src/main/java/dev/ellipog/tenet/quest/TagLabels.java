/**
 * A tag id as a player reads it: "Any Iron Ores" for {@code c:ores/iron}, "Any Planks" for
 * {@code minecraft:planks}.
 *
 * <h2>Where this is used, and why the raw id survives beside it</h2>
 *
 * <p>The item_tag task's display takes this as its subject, so the row reads "Hand in Any Iron Ores"
 * instead of "Hand in #Ores/iron": a tag id is the author's spelling, and parsing it is not a
 * player's job. The raw tag is not lost — it travels as the row's {@code tagId}, the book's hover
 * prints it, and the viewer adapters build their tag ingredients from it. The humanized label is for
 * reading; the id is for naming exactly what to hand in.
 *
 * <h2>The shape this follows, and what it refuses to guess</h2>
 *
 * <p>Convention tags name a category and a member — {@code c:ores/iron} is iron among ores — and the
 * label says the member first because English does ("Any Iron Ores"). A flat tag is just a name. The
 * namespace is dropped: it groups tags for authors, and a player reading "Any Planks" has no use for
 * "minecraft".
 *
 * <p>Nothing here pluralizes or translates: the words are the id's own, title-cased, and an author
 * who wants better words gives the quest a title. And an id that does not fit the shape at all — an
 * empty path, a stray slash — comes back as the raw id rather than as an exception: a display helper
 * is not a validator, and a row must not fail to draw over a malformed tag the server accepted.
