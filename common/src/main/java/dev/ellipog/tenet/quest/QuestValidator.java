/**
 * Checks one quest file against the format, reporting everything wrong with it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists when Minecraft has codecs</h2>
 *
 * <p>Codecs turn JSON into objects, and are excellent at it. What they cannot do is say <i>where</i>
 * the problem is, and they ignore fields they do not recognise. Both of those matter enormously for
 * a format people edit by hand:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code "titl": "Punch a Tree"} produces a quest with a blank title, no error, and nothing in
 *       any log. The author compares two files character by character to find it.</li>
 *   <li>A codec failure reports {@code Missing field "title"} and a file name — not the line.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This walks the same file <b>before</b> the codec runs, using the same field sets the records
 * declare, so the two cannot drift: if a record gains a field, this allows it in the same commit.
 * A file with a structural error is not decoded at all, which is why one mistake produces one
 * message rather than a validator complaint followed by a codec complaint about the same thing.
 *
 * <h2>What it checks</h2>
 *
 * <p>Structure and values: every required field present, every field a known one, every enum name
 * valid, every id well-formed, every item that actually exists. What it deliberately does <b>not</b>
 * check is anything needing more than this file — duplicate ids across files, dependencies that point
 * at nothing. That is {@link QuestIndex}, because a file on its own cannot know.
