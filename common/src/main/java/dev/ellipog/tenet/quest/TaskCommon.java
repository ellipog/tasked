/**
 * The settings every task has, whatever its type.
 *
 * <p>A separate record so these fields are declared once. It is a {@link MapCodec} so that each
 * task type embeds it <b>flat</b> — a task says {@code "optional": true} at its own level, not
 * {@code "common": {"optional": true}}. Each type's codec merges this in and adds its own fields,
 * which keeps a type's own codec down to the fields that make it that type.
 *
 * <p>{@code autoSubmitTicks} is borrowed from FTB Quests, which tries a task on a per-type schedule
 * rather than every tick — a short interval for a checkmark, a long one for an observation. One
 * field, and the alternative is a mod that scans every player's inventory twenty times a second for
 * nothing.
 *
 * <p>{@code conditions} is the gate: every condition must hold before this task counts for a player,
 * asked per member exactly where the engine asks for their count. Empty is the common case and costs
 * nothing — see {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.quest.condition.Conditions}. The short constructor keeps the
 * seventeen task types from each carrying a list they never fill; the codec still reads and writes the
 * field flat, beside {@code optional}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * { "type": "tenet:checkmark", "conditions": [ { "type": "tenet:stage", "stage": "pack:marked" } ] }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code disableToast} is FTB Quests' {@code disable_toast} on the task: this task finishing
 * raises no task toast. It ORs with the quest's own flag and the silent auto-claim modes where
 * notices are decided — a quieted task in an announced quest stays quiet, and an announced task
 * in a quieted quest stays quiet too.
 *
 * <p>{@code title} and {@code icon} are the author's overrides: the words the row wears instead of
 * the type's own sentence, and the picture it wears instead of the type's own. Absent means the
 * type decides, which is every file written before these fields existed. See
 * {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.quest.task.TaskTypes#displayOf} for the resolution.
 *
 * <p>{@code tags} is FTB Quests' {@code tags}, present on every object: words this task answers
 * to in lookups by tag. Each tag is {@code ^[a-z0-9_]{1,64}$}, the same rule an id follows.
