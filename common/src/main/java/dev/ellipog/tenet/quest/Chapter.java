/**
 * A group of quests drawn on one canvas.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   "id": "stone_age",
 *   "title": "The Stone Age",
 *   "icon": { "item": "minecraft:cobblestone" },
 *   "defaultPrerequisiteMode": "all_completed",
 *   "progressionMode": "linear",
 *   "quests": [ ... ]
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>The chapter-level defaults, and why they earn their place</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code defaultPrerequisiteMode} is FTB Quests' {@code default_quest_prerequisite_mode}. A
 * chapter of thirty quests in a chain would otherwise repeat {@code "prerequisiteMode":
 * "all_completed"} thirty times, and the one place it differed would be easy to miss.
 *
 * <p>{@code progressionMode} goes further: {@code linear} makes the <b>order of the quests list</b>
 * the progression, so a chain needs no {@code dependsOn} at all. Those two together mean a
 * straightforward chapter is a list of quests and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>{@code defaultConsumeItems} is the inheritance the plan called out from FTB Quests' model: a
 * task can decide for itself whether taking the items is required, and a chapter can set the
 * default so that "this pack takes your resources" is one word rather than a decision made
 * thirty times. Defaults to false, because silently taking a player's items is the more surprising
 * of the two behaviours.
 *
 * <h2>{@code theme}: a chapter may dress itself, and it is a weak claim rather than a strong one</h2>
 *
 * <p>Optional, and absent means "no opinion" rather than "the default theme". That distinction is the
 * whole design. The setting a player chooses is the baseline; this is an <b>override</b> that lasts
 * while you are looking at this chapter and is released when you leave. So a gallery chapter can
 * demonstrate a theme by being clicked rather than by being explained, and a pack author's taste can
 * never become a setting the player cannot get out of — clicking the appearance control in the book's
 * sidebar always wins, and clears this at the same time.
 *
 * <p>Validated as a plain string here rather than against a list of theme names, and that is a
 * deliberate boundary rather than an omission: the theme catalogue lives on the client, and a
 * dedicated server has no business knowing what themes a client has. So an unrecognised name is
 * reported by the client that could not honour it, once, naming the chapter — which is the same
 * treatment a value that reached the wrong side would get anywhere else in this codebase.
