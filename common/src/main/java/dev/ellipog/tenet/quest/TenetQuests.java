 * <p>Loaded from {@code SERVER_STARTED}, not {@code SERVER_STARTING}. The two fire at genuinely
 * different points on the two loaders — on Fabric, {@code SERVER_STARTING} arrives before the game has
 * even logged starting the server, with no level in existence. Reading files there would work, but
 * anything that wanted the level would not, and the same code would then break on one loader only.
 *
 * <p>{@code SERVER_STARTED} is well-defined on both. Cheap to get right, and the alternative is a
 * bug that appears on one loader and not the other.
 *
 * <h2>Reload</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #reload} is what makes hand-editing bearable: change a file, run {@code /tenet reload},
 * see the tree and any problems in the log, without restarting. That loop is the reason the
 * line-numbered validator exists at all.
