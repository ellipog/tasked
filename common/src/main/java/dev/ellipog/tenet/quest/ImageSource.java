/**
 * Where a picture element's picture comes from: a file, or a region of a stitched sheet.
 *
 * <h2>Why two arms, and why this is not one field</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because they are two different lookups that fail differently, and both are in real use. A
 * {@link Texture} names a PNG by path, which the resource manager either has or does not — and an absent
 * file draws nothing at all. A {@link Sprite} names a region of a sheet the game assembled at load time,
 * and an id the sheet does not hold draws the game's missing-texture marker. Neither can stand in for the
 * other: a sprite has no path to give, and a file has no place in an atlas.
 *
 * <p>This is the shape FTB Quests uses under one string, decided by whether the value ends in
 * {@code .png} — a rule that lives in its parser rather than in its files. Here the two are separate keys,
 * so which lookup an element asks for is written down rather than inferred, and the migration tool applies
 * the suffix rule once, in the open, where its report can name what it did.
 *
 * <h2>Exactly one key, and the validator is what says so</h2>
 *
 * <p>The codec reads the object left to right and takes {@code texture} if it is there, which means an
 * object carrying both silently loses its {@code sprite}. That is the loader's usual leniency — a codec
 * error would cost the author every quest in the chapter — and the check that a message can be attached
 * to belongs to {@link QuestValidator}, which reads the raw object and can name the line. An object
 * carrying neither is the one case the codec does refuse, because there is nothing to draw and no
 * sensible value to invent.
