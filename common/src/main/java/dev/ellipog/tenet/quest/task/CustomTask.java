/**
 * A task whose progress is somebody else's code.
 *
 * <pre>{@code { "type": "tenet:custom", "id": "my_pack:unlock_the_vault", "value": 1 } }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The hook a pack reaches for when no task type anticipated what it wants to ask. A mod registers a
 * handler through {@link CustomTasks#register} during its construction, or a script configures the same
 * registry through the KubeJS integration; the handler is asked how far along the player is, and the quest
 * engine treats the answer exactly as it treats a stat's or a kill count's.
 *
 * <p>Mirrors {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.quest.reward.CustomReward} deliberately -- same id-keyed registry,
 * same "a script configures the same map" -- so there is one shape to learn for both halves of a quest.
 *
 * <h2>Why the id is required</h2>
 *
 * <p>The handler is what measures, so an id-less custom task has nothing to ask and could never complete.
 * That is a property of the engine rather than a choice here: progress is only ever what a behaviour
 * reports -- there is no path by which code or a command says "task 2 of this quest is now done" -- so a
 * custom task is a <i>measured</i> task or it is nothing. A code path that advances a task from outside is
 * what an anonymous one would need, and that belongs with the scripting work rather than with this type.
