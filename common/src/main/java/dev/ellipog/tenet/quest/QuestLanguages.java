/**
 * The pack's own translations: {@code config/tenet/quests/lang/<locale>.json}, one file per locale.
 *
 * <h2>Why the text lives beside the book rather than in it</h2>
 *
 * <p>FTB Quests stores <b>all</b> quest text in {@code lang/<locale>.snbt} and none of it in the
 * chapter files, and ATM10 ships fifteen locales. A Tenet tree that could only hold one language
 * would force every such pack to be flattened on import, so the translations need a home of their
 * own — and it must be a home the tree does not have to be rebuilt around.
 *
 * <p>So this is deliberately <b>not</b> part of {@link QuestIndex}. A locale file is not a chapter,
 * not a quest and not a reward table: nothing in it has a position on a canvas or a state to track,
 * and the tree's shape is identical whichever language it is read in. The book loads without it, the
 * sync carries the tree's canonical strings as the fallback, and a locale is an overlay applied on
 * top of what the tree already says.
 *
 * <h2>What a file is</h2>
 *
 * <p>A flat object of key to text, exactly the shape a resource pack's language file has:
 *
 * <pre>{@code { "quest.punch_a_tree.title": "Találd meg a fát" }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The file's own name is the locale id — {@code es_es.json} is {@code es_es} — because there is
 * no second place to declare one and a name that no client can ask for is simply never looked up.
 * A name is normalised to lower case with {@code -} read as {@code _}, so {@code en-US.json} is
 * {@code en_us}.
 *
 * <h2>Loading never throws, and a bad file never stops the book</h2>
 *
 * <p>A file that does not parse, or a value that is not a string, is reported against its own line
 * and the file is refused. The rest load, and the questline is unaffected: an author with a typo in
 * a translation should get a working book, the file named, and the offending key pointed at — not a
 * server that refuses to start or a book that will not open.
 *
 * <h2>Keys that name nothing warn, and never fail</h2>
 *
 * <p>A key for a quest that was deleted, or written against the wrong id, is otherwise silent: the
 * overlay merges, the lookup misses, and the tree's own string stays on screen with nothing saying
 * which file holds the dead key. {@link #warnStale} reports those after the load, as warnings, so
 * a converted pack with leftover keys still loads cleanly. Keys in no book-shaped namespace are
 * left alone — scripts may own them.
