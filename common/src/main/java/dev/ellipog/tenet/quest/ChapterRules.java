/**
 * A chapter's own progression: what it waits on, what finishes it, and whether it is shown before then.
 *
 * <h2>Why these five are grouped rather than fields of {@link Chapter}</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same mundane reason {@link QuestRules} is grouped, with the same real one behind it.
 * {@code RecordCodecBuilder} takes at most sixteen components and {@link Chapter} is a container of
 * fourteen, so five more inline fields do not fit. They belong together anyway: everything here is
 * about how a chapter relates to the <i>rest of the progression</i> rather than about what it holds.
 *
 * <p>In JSON the fields are <b>flat</b> on {@code chapter.json} — {@code "dependsOn": [...]}, not
 * {@code "rules": { ... }} — because this is a {@link MapCodec}, exactly as a quest's flags are flat
 * on the quest. An author should not have to nest an object to say what a chapter waits for.
 *
 * <h2>A chapter's gate, and the field it is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #prerequisiteMode} is the rule over this chapter's <b>own</b> dependencies: how many of
 * the chapters in {@link #dependsOn} must be satisfied, and whether "satisfied" means completed or
 * merely started. It is deliberately <b>not</b> {@link Chapter#defaultPrerequisiteMode()}, which is
 * the opposite direction — the mode a quest in this chapter inherits for its quest dependencies. The
 * two names sit one accessor apart, which is why the accessors are spelled out rather than left to a
 * reader to infer: {@code chapter.rules().prerequisiteMode()} is this chapter waiting on others, and
 * {@code chapter.defaultPrerequisiteMode()} is a quest inside it waiting on quests.
 *
 * <p>{@link #minRequired} is the same field a quest has, read the same way: it replaces the mode's
 * <b>count</b> and never its bar, so {@code one_started} with {@code minRequired: 2} is "any two of
 * these chapters, started". A value above the size of {@link #dependsOn} is refused at load, the way
 * a quest's is.
 *
 * <h2>{@code completesWhen}: what "this chapter is finished" means, and why it is declared</h2>
 *
 * <p>A chapter is <b>completed</b> when every quest named here is completed. It cannot be derived from
 * "all of its quests are done", and the reason is not a matter of taste: a chapter may hold an
 * {@code exclusiveGroup} — where completing one quest permanently locks its siblings — or a
 * {@code maxCompletableDependents} cap that does the same to a branch. A rule of "every quest in the
 * chapter" would therefore be unsatisfiable in exactly the chapters that use those two fields, and
 * every chapter depending on them would lock forever with nothing to point at. So completion is
 * declared, and a dependency whose bar is <i>completed</i> on a chapter that declares nothing here is
 * reported at load rather than discovered as a chapter that never opens.
 *
 * <p>The quests named may live in any chapter, and are resolved by id or alias like every other
 * reference in this format. A repeatable quest named here counts after its <b>first</b> completion and
 * stays counted however many times it is repeated, which is the same reading a quest dependency gets.
 *
 * <h2>{@code hideUntilDependenciesComplete}: hiding is presentation, the gate is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>The chapter's gate is enforced by the engine whatever this says: a quest in a chapter whose
 * dependencies are unmet cannot be started, finished or claimed. This flag decides only whether the
 * <b>row</b> is drawn before that — {@code true} removes the chapter from the book for a reader until
 * its gate is met, {@code false} (the default) lists it dimmed with what it is waiting for. That split
 * is the same one the quest reveal family makes, and for the same reason: an author needs to keep
 * working on a chapter whose contents are not in play yet, so the flag is honoured by the reader's
 * book and never by the editor.
