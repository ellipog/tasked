/**
 * What each {@link EditorField.Source} is: the registry it reads, and the grammar its values are written in.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a separate class from the catalogue</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because these are facts about the <i>format</i>, and the catalogue is a fact about a running client.
 * {@code SearchCatalogue} needs {@code Minecraft} to gather a list; this needs nothing at runtime, so
 * every question here is a unit test rather than something only a launched game can answer. That matters
 * more than tidiness for one of them: the rule below is the one the structure picker broke, and a rule
 * whose only enforcement is a running game is a rule that gets broken again.
 *
 * <h2>The rule</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A list may only be read from a registry the client is sent.</b> 1.21.1 sends a client eleven
 * datapack registries -- the biomes, the enchantments, the dimension types, the trim materials and their
 * neighbours -- and it builds the rest of its static ones at startup. Everything else a datapack defines
 * is the server's: a structure, a structure set, a placed feature, a level stem. Reading one of those from
 * the client's registry access does not throw. It answers an <i>empty</i> registry, so the picker opens
 * with no rows and no explanation, which is how {@code STRUCTURE} shipped. {@link #registryFor} names the
 * registry for every source, {@code null} for the ones no client registry answers, and the test beside
 * this class checks each answer against 1.21.1's own sets.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link EditorField} and {@link EditorSpecs}, nothing here mentions a client type: a task or a
 * reward type lives on both sides and carries its editor with it.
