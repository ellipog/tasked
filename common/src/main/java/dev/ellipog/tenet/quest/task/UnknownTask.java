/**
 * A task whose type this build has no codec for, kept rather than thrown away.
 *
 * <pre>{@code { "type": "some_addon:reticulate", "splines": 4 } }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>One node in a file naming a task type that is not registered here: an addon that is not installed,
 * a type an addon registered on the server but not on the client, or a file written by a newer build
 * than this one. Before this existed the dispatch refused to decode the type at all, and because a codec
 * error refuses the <b>whole document</b>, one such node cost the author every quest in the file.
 *
 * <p>So the id survives, the file loads, and the node is drawn as what it is. The payload's own fields
 * are not carried here — a {@link com.mojang.serialization.MapCodec} never sees the raw object — but
 * they are not lost either: the editor writes back the tree it read, so anything this build does not
 * understand is still on disk after a save. See {@code TypeDispatch} for the whole argument.
 *
 * <h2>What it does, and why that is the safe direction</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing, deliberately, and {@link #BEHAVIOUR} says so in numbers rather than by omission:
 * {@code required} is 1 and {@code current} is always 0, so the task can never be satisfied and the
 * quest sits visibly incomplete instead of silently completing itself. That is the same reading
 * {@code ProgressionEngine} already gave an unregistered behaviour before this class existed, so no
 * quest's progression changes; what changes is that the file is readable.
 *
 * <p>Completing it instead would be the dangerous direction — a quest whose requirements this build
 * cannot evaluate would hand out its rewards for nothing.
 *
 * <h2>It is never registered</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no {@code register} call for this type and there must not be: {@link #type()} returns the
 * id that was in the file, which is precisely the id the registry does <b>not</b> have. Registering it
 * would need one id, and there is one of these per unknown id.
