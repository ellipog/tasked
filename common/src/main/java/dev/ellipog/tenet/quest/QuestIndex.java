/**
 * Every loaded quest, indexed, with the cross-file checks done.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is separate from the validator</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because it needs to see all of them. A file on its own cannot know that {@code punch_a_tree}
 * already exists in another file, or that a {@code dependsOn} points at a quest that was deleted.
 * That is a different job from "is this file well-formed", and keeping them apart means the validator
 * stays a per-file check while this runs once over everything.
 *
 * <p>Duplicate identifiers are reported <b>only</b> here, including duplicates within one file. The
 * validator has no cross-quest state, so it cannot see them, and having exactly one place that
 * decides whether an id is taken means there is never a case where two checks disagree about it.
 *
 * <h2>Identifiers, and why aliases matter</h2>
 *
 * <p>A quest is looked up by id <b>or alias</b>, everywhere: in {@code dependsOn}, in commands, in the
 * editor. That is what makes renaming a quest safe. Progress is stored against whatever id the quest
 * had when a player completed it, so without aliases a rename silently discards every player's
 * progress through that quest — a mistake FTB Quests lets you make.
 *
 * <p>So there is one table keyed by both, and a clash between them is an error: if one quest's id
 * collides with another's alias, a lookup is ambiguous, and ambiguity here means somebody's progress
 * lands on the wrong quest.
 *
 * <h2>Lookups are case-insensitive; files stay lowercase</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every key in the three tables is stored lowercased, and every lookup lowercases first — so an
 * id, an alias and any case mix of either resolve to the same entry. That is for FTB Quests, whose
 * ids are uppercase hexadecimal and whose own reads never cared about case: a string an author, a
 * command or a script wrote down may be in either case, and "the case is wrong" is not a failure
 * FTB has ever had. Each entry keeps its own id, so nothing displayed or stored changes — player
 * progress is keyed by canonical id and is untouched.
 *
 * <p>The validator still requires lowercase ids and dependency strings, and aliases may use
 * uppercase: the validator's job is to keep files uniform, the lookup's job is to not break a
 * reference somebody wrote correctly in another case. An alias that normalises onto another
 * object's id or alias is still a hard error, and an alias that normalises onto its own id is
 * also still an error — it differs from the id only in case, so it says nothing.
 *
 * <h2>A {@code #tag} resolves to the first object carrying it</h2>
 *
 * <p>FTB Quests' tag lookup: quests, chapters and groups each carry {@code tags}, and a lookup
 * string of {@code "#village"} resolves to the first object of the asked kind with that tag, in
 * declaration order. The three kinds resolve separately -- see {@link #questWithTag} -- so a tag
 * shared by a quest and a chapter answers whichever the caller asked for. Dependency edges keep
 * their id-or-alias charset (the validator refuses a {@code #} there), so this is for commands,
 * scripts and clicks: the surfaces that name one thing to open or check, not the edges that gate.

     * The tree, in declaration order: every group, then every chapter, then every quest.
     *
     * <h2>Why three stored lists rather than five copies of the same walk</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because five separate places used to walk <i>the files</i> and flatten the tree themselves,
     * each with its own nested loop: this class's own {@code quests()}, {@link
     * dev.ellipog.tenet.net.QuestSync}'s tree writer, {@link
     * dev.ellipog.tenet.progress.ProgressionEngine}'s chapter list, {@code TenetCommand}'s group
     * list, and two test helpers. Five loops, one shape, and nothing keeping them in step — so a
     * change to what "a chapter" is had to be made in five places, and the four that were missed
     * would compile and produce a shorter list than expected rather than an error.
     *
     * <p>The order is <b>declaration order</b>: groups in the order the loader found them, a group's
     * chapters in the order its manifest lists them, and a chapter's quests in the order its manifest
     * lists them. That last one is load-bearing rather than cosmetic — a LINEAR chapter's progression
     * <i>is</i> its quest list order — which is why the position is carried on the entry rather than
     * being counted again wherever it is needed. See {@link QuestEntry#orderInChapter}.
     *
     * <p>A fourth derived map joined them with chapter dependencies: each chapter's own quests, keyed by
     * chapter id ({@link #questsIn}). A chapter's state is a question about the quests inside it, and it
     * is asked once per chapter per pass, so the grouping is built once here rather than filtered out of
     * the flat list wherever it is wanted — the same argument, one level down.

     * reason: every consumer that needs one would otherwise look it up, and there are three such
     * consumers. The chapter is cheap — it is a shared reference, not a copy — and holding it means
     * {@code progressionMode}, {@code theme} and {@code defaultPrerequisiteMode} come off the entry
     * rather than out of a map.
     *
     * <p>{@code orderInChapter} is the important one, and it is not an optimisation. It is the
     * position the quest holds <b>in the same list</b> a LINEAR chapter gates on, taken at the moment
     * that list is walked. A version recounted somewhere else is a second description of one fact,
     * and the way that goes wrong is the way that cannot be seen: a prefix of the chapter that is

     * node), so this is no longer a rendering fault. It is still a layout that will not show what the
     * author wrote, and the useful moment to say so is when the file loads.
