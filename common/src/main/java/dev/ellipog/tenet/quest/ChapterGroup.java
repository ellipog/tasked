/**
 * A shelf of chapters — FTB Quests' "chapter group".
 *
 * <p>Exists so a large pack can say "Tutorial / Progression / Endgame" and put twenty chapters
 * underneath, rather than scrolling one flat list of twenty. The extra level of nesting costs one
 * record and makes the navigation panel readable at scale, which is why FTB Quests grew the same
 * level after not having it.
 *
 * <h2>Its description is a list of paragraphs, and that was found the hard way</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not one string. {@link Chapter}'s description has always been a list, and {@link Quest}'s own
 * javadoc argues the point at length — a single string with {@code \n} in it is what FTB Quests takes,
 * and it is why its quest descriptions become one undifferentiated wall of text. That argument does
 * not stop applying one level up.
 *
 * <p>It was a single {@code Optional<QuestText>} until a second shipped questline caught it by being
 * written the obvious way: an array of lines, exactly like a chapter's, failed to decode, and the
 * failure arrived as a codec message at <b>line 1 column 1</b> saying the format had rejected the
 * file. That is the exact failure this project's whole validator exists to prevent — a message that
 * names the wrong place, about a field the validator had never been taught to look at, so it stayed
 * silent and let the codec speak from the root of the file.
 *
 * <p>A bare string is still accepted, so nothing that works today stops working. The union costs one
 * {@code xmap}: a one-line group description written as a string is not a mistake worth failing a
 * file over.
