/**
 * A reward that rolls from a table: {@code random}, {@code loot}, {@code all_table} and

 *
 * <pre>{@code { "type": "tenet:loot", "table": "dungeon" } }</pre>
 *
 * <p>One record with four modes rather than four records, because they share every field and differ
 * only in what they do with the roll — and FTB Quests' four types differ the same way. The mode is
 * fixed at registration, so a file cannot turn a {@code random} into a {@code choice} by adding a
 * field; the type id <i>is</i> the mode.
 *
 * <h2>Choice does not roll at claim time</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code random}, {@code loot} and {@code all_table} resolve the moment the reward is granted.
 * {@code choice} cannot: the player picks, so the claim marks nothing, sends the entries to the
 * client, and the answer comes back as its own operation — see
 * {@code ProgressService.claimChoice}. A choice reward therefore stays outstanding until it is
 * answered, which also means a crash between the offer and the pick loses nothing.
