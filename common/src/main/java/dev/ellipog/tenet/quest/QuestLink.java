/**
 * A quest drawn on a chapter that is not one of its own: a marker pointing elsewhere.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * { "id": "gate_hint", "quest": "the_deep_descent", "x": 336, "y": -64 }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>What a link is, and the three things it is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is a <b>node that mirrors another quest</b>: it draws in the node layer with the target's
 * state and icon, and pressing it opens the target — including across chapters, where the book
 * switches to the chapter that holds it. It is not a quest (it holds no progress, is never
 * counted for its chapter's completion, and no dependency, gate or milestone may name it), it is
 * not a dependency (nothing unlocks through it, and the ghost check does not count it as a
 * dependant), and it is not a canvas element (elements draw <i>beneath</i> the nodes and hold no
 * state; a link draws <i>among</i> them and reads the target's). Those three negatives are the
 * property to keep in mind when a link wants a new field: a link with a gate is a quest, and a
 * link with a press action of its own is an element.
 *
 * <h2>Where the defaults come from</h2>
 *
 * <p>FTB's links carry only an id, a target and a position; shape and size are the <i>quest's</i>
 * own, read from the target at draw time. Here they are link-local with the quest's own defaults
 * standing in — {@code rounded} and 48 pixels, clamped to the same 16..512 a quest node allows —
 * so a link that says nothing draws exactly as its target does, and one that says something is a
 * deliberate difference. The bounds live on {@link QuestLayout}, where the geometry they describe
 * lives, so the codec, the validator and the client cannot disagree about them.
 *
 * <h2>Ids live with the quests, not with the decorations</h2>
 *
 * <p>A link's id must not equal any quest id or alias the index knows, in any letter case: the
 * canvas addresses nodes by id, and a link sharing its target's name — the shape every converted
 * pack's hex ids take — would be a node that can never be addressed. Element ids are a separate
 * namespace the link does not join: elements are addressed by edit operations, links by the canvas,
 * and neither reaches through the other. The migration tool lowercases FTB's ids and maps
 * {@code linked_quest} onto {@code quest}; coordinates arrive as integers, scaled and
 * corner-based by the tool exactly as quest positions are.
