/**
 * The settings every reward has, whatever its type.
 *
 * <p>The reward half of {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.quest.TaskCommon}, and the same shape: a
 * {@link MapCodec} embedded <b>flat</b>, so a reward says {@code "auto": "no_toast"} at its own level
 * rather than under a nested object. Each type's codec merges this in and adds the fields that make
 * it that type.
 *
 * <h2>The four original fields, and where their defaults live</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code team}, {@code auto} and the tree's file both follow FTB Quests' resolution: an explicit
 * value wins, and silence defers to the quest tree's own settings — which is why the tristate is an
 * {@code Optional<Boolean>} and not a boolean. The two flags are plain booleans whose absence is
 * simply false, because that is what they mean.
 *
 * <p>{@link #FIELDS} is unioned into every registered type by
 * {@link RewardTypes#register(net.minecraft.resources.ResourceLocation, MapCodec, Set,
 * RewardBehaviour, dev.ellipog.tenet.quest.ItemRef, java.util.function.Function,
 * java.util.function.Supplier)}, so a type that embeds this codec cannot forget to declare them —
 * and an addon's type that does not embed it is a mistake the validator's codec check reports at
 * the file's own line.
 *
 * <h2>{@code conditions}</h2>
 *
 * <p>The gate on being paid: every condition must hold for the player a payout would go to, checked
 * on every path that pays — the claim, claim-all, the choice answer, and both automatic ones. A
 * reward whose conditions are unmet is not lost: it stays unclaimed, and the same paths pick it up
 * the moment they hold. The short constructor keeps every existing default and test from carrying a
 * list they never fill.
 *
 * <p>{@code disableToast} is FTB Quests' {@code disable_toast} on the reward: collecting this
 * reward raises no toast. Rewards have no toast of their own today — only quest and task notices
 * exist — so this is recorded on the model, the wire and the editor now, and honoured the moment a
 * reward-level notice does. An announced reward in a quieted quest stays quiet; the quest's flag
 * already covers that path.
 *
 * <p>{@code title} and {@code icon} are the author's overrides: the words the row wears instead of
 * the type's own sentence, and the picture it wears instead of the type's own. Absent means the
 * type decides, which is every file written before these fields existed. See
 * {@link RewardTypes#displayOf} for the resolution.
