/**
 * A task the player completes by saying so — a button, and a promise.
 *
 * <pre>{@code { "type": "tenet:checkmark", "title": "Did you read the sign?" } }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The words live in the task's {@link TaskCommon#title() common title} rather than on this
 * record: every task type carries an author title now, and a checkmark's is simply the only one
 * that is ever drawn without an item beside it. The key is unchanged — {@code "title"} sat flat on
 * the task before the shared field existed — so every file written before the move reads the same
 * way. A checkmark that says nothing draws "{@code ?}", which is the honest answer for a button
 * with no words rather than the type's name for itself.
 *
 * <p>{@link #required} is one and {@link #current} is always zero, which is what makes it
 * manual-only: no amount of observing the world will ever satisfy it, so the engine's auto-submit
 * pass skips it and only a submit advances it. That falls out of the two numbers rather than needing
 * a special case in the engine, which is the point of the {@link TaskBehaviour} shape.
