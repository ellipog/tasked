/**
 * How a quest presents itself: how wide its card wants to be, which of its edges are drawn, and
 * whether its arrival is announced.
 *
 * <p>Grouped into its own record for the mundane reason {@link QuestRules} and {@link QuestLayout}
 * give — {@code RecordCodecBuilder} stops at sixteen components and {@link Quest} is at fifteen
 * without these — and the real one: all but the last are about how a quest <i>reads</i> rather than
 * what it asks for or what gates it. In JSON the fields are <b>flat</b> on the quest, because this is a
 * {@link MapCodec}, exactly as a quest's rules and layout are flat on the quest. An author writes
 * {@code "minWidth": 250}, not a nested object.
 *
 * <p>{@code minWidth} is FTB Quests' {@code min_width}: the minimum width of the quest's detail
 * panel. Zero means unset — the panel takes its kind's default — because every file written before
 * this field existed says nothing, and nothing must read as the old behaviour. The chapter's
 * {@code defaultMinWidth} decides for a quest that says nothing; a quest's own value wins.
 *
 * <p>{@code hideDependentLines} is the outgoing half of {@code hideDependencyLines}. That flag
 * hides the lines <i>arriving</i> at a quest; this one hides the lines <i>leaving</i> it for its
 * dependants. FTB Quests ships both halves ({@code hide_dependency_lines} and
 * {@code hide_dependent_lines}); this mod had only the incoming side, so a converted pack's 375
 * uses of the outgoing half had nowhere to land.
 *
 * <p>{@code disableToast} is FTB Quests' {@code disable_toast} on the quest: completing this quest
 * raises no toast. It ORs with the silent auto-claim modes rather than replacing them — an author
 * who turned auto-claim on for fifty starter quests and an author who quieted one quest by name are
 * answering the same question from opposite ends. Tasks and rewards carry their own flag beside
 * their own common settings; see {@link TaskCommon} and
 * {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.quest.reward.RewardCommon}.
 *
 * <p>{@code ignoreRewardBlocking} is FTB Quests' {@code ignore_reward_blocking} on the quest: when
 * the team's payouts are held, this quest's rewards keep flowing. Either the quest's flag or a
 * reward's own flag exempts that reward — the quest's covers every reward on it, the reward's
 * covers just itself. See {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.progress.ProgressService#isBlocked}.
 *
 * <p>{@code requiresStageTeam} qualifies the quest's {@code requiresStage} gate (which lives in
 * {@link QuestRules} because the rules record filled first): read the team's stages rather than the
 * player's own. One member's induction then opens the quest for everybody. It sits here for the
 * mundane codec reason above, flat on the quest like everything else in this record.
 *
 * <p>{@code disableRecipeMod} is FTB Quests' {@code disable_recipe_mod} on the quest (shown in its
 * editor as {@code disable_jei}): this quest stays out of recipe viewers (JEI, REI, EMI). A
 * tristate — absent defers to the file's {@code defaultDisableRecipeMod}, which is what every file
 * written before this field existed says. See {@link Quest#showInRecipeMod}.
 *
 * <p>{@code hideLockIcon} is the quest's half of the file's {@code showLockIcons}: this quest
 * wears no lock mark on the canvas. Either silence wins — the file hiding every mark, or this
 * quest hiding its own — and absent defers to the file.
 *
 * <p>{@code tags} is FTB Quests' {@code tags}, present on every object: words this quest answers
 * to in lookups by tag. Each tag is {@code ^[a-z0-9_]{1,64}$}, the same rule a quest id follows,
 * and a lookup of {@code "#tag"} resolves to the first quest, chapter or group carrying it.
 *
 * <p>{@code guidePage} is FTB Quests' {@code guide_page}: the guide book page this quest belongs
 * to, as a plain string. Tenet has no guide integration, so this is carried as a reference the
 * quest card shows and nothing more; empty means the quest names none.
