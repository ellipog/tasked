 *
 * <h2>Four things, and deliberately only four</h2>
 *
 * <p>An image, a text label, a line with optional arrowheads, and a filled box with a border. Every one of
 * them is a shape the seam can already draw — a blit, a line of text, a run of rectangles — and none of
 * them needs a subsystem: there is no renderer change here that is not a blit, no layout engine, and no
 * second font. The three drawn ones are <b>procedural on purpose</b>: an author labels a section, divides
 * a tier or groups a cluster of quests without opening an image editor or shipping an asset, which is what
 * makes a decorated chapter something a pack author does rather than something they commission.
 *
 * <h2>Images are FTB's chapter images, and the other three are ours</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Image} carries every field FTB Quests writes on a {@code ChapterImage}, so a converted pack
 * loses nothing: the position, the size, the rotation about the centre (or the corner), the tint and its
 * separate alpha, the draw order, the visibility gate on a quest, the dev-only flag, the hover title and
 * the five properties of text painted on the picture. See {@code Argb}, {@link ImageSource} and
 * {@link ClickAction} for the three fields whose vocabulary needed its own decision.
 *
 * <p>The other three arms have no FTB counterpart at all — FTB quasar has no procedural element — so they
 * are new surface with no compatibility question attached, and a converter never emits them.
 *
 * <h2>Decorations, and the one thing they can never do</h2>
 *
 * <p>An element is <b>not</b> content. It is never counted for a chapter's completion, it is never a
 * dependency, it holds no progress and it cannot gate anything — the only relation it has to progression
 * is {@code requires}, which reads a quest's state and changes nothing about it. That is what lets the
 * whole family be classified as a cosmetic edit by the editor, and it is the property to keep in mind when
 * adding a fifth one.
 *
 * <p>All of them draw <b>under</b> the dependency lines and the quest nodes, ordered among themselves by
 * {@code order} and then by the order they are declared in. Which is FTB's own arrangement, and the reason
 * a box can be a container for a group of quests rather than a lid over them.
 *
 * <h2>A closed set, and a placeholder for a type this build has never heard of</h2>
 *
 * <p>A sealed interface rather than an open registry: these four are the format, and an addon that wants a
 * fifth is a conversation about the format rather than a registration. {@link Unknown} exists for the same
 * reason {@code UnknownTask} does — one element naming a type from a newer build must not cost the author
 * every quest in the chapter — and it is strictly better than that placeholder in one respect: the common
 * fields are readable without the type's codec, so an unknown element still has an id, an order and a gate,
 * and the editor can still select and delete it.

     * @param tint     multiplied into the picture, RGB and alpha alike. <b>White is the identity</b>, which
     *                 is its default, and a tint that carries an alpha <i>multiplies</i> with {@code alpha}
     *                 rather than replacing it — so "fade this" has one meaning whichever of the two fields
     *                 an author reaches for. FTB's own writer is narrower than that and the difference is a
     *                 converter's problem rather than a reader's: it writes {@code Color4I.rgb()} — no alpha
     *                 in the number at all — and draws the tint with the {@code alpha} field <i>replacing</i>
     *                 the colour's own alpha. So a converted picture is written {@code #FFRRGGBB}, and with
     *                 an opaque tint this format's multiplication and FTB's replacement are the same sum.
     * @param alpha    0..255, multiplied with {@code tint}'s own alpha. Carried separately because FTB
     *                 carries it separately, and because a pack that dims a picture should not have to
     *                 rewrite its colour to say so

     * @param label    how that text is painted, when it is
     * @param click    what pressing it does. See {@link ClickAction} for the four names this build refuses.
