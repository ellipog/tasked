 *
 * <p>FTB Quests' {@code currency} reward, which pays through FTBLibrary's currency hook rather
 * than granting an item: the amount is the only field, and the coin it names belongs to whichever
 * currency mod is installed. Tenet does the same through {@link CurrencyProviders}: a currency mod
 * (or a script) registers its paying half, and this reward calls it. With nothing registered the
 * grant warns once in the log and pays nothing — a pack whose economy mod is missing keeps its
 * quests, the way a pack whose custom handler is missing keeps its own.
