/**
 * A quest's behaviour flags, grouped.
 *
 * <p>Grouped for a mundane reason and a real one. {@code RecordCodecBuilder} takes at most sixteen
 * components, and a flat {@link Quest} with these inline would be over the limit — so they have
 * to go somewhere. They belong together anyway: these are the flags that change how a quest behaves
 * rather than what it contains, and the editor shows them on one panel.
 *
 * <p>In JSON the fields are <b>flat</b> on the quest — {@code "repeatable": true}, not
 * {@code "rules": {"repeatable": true}} — because this is a {@link MapCodec}. An author should not
 * have to nest an object to set a flag.
 *
 * <h2>The two families here, and why the second one arrived</h2>
 *
 * <p>The first flags are about what a quest <i>is</i>: repeatable, sequential, invisible, named,
 * exclusive — and now <i>optional</i>: a quest that does not gate its dependants. The rest are about
 * what a player may <b>see and when</b> — a family FTB Quests ships and
 * this mod did not, and the reason they are worth having is that a questline with a surprise in it
 * cannot be written without them. A locked quest is normally <i>shown</i> as locked, which is the
 * point of a map; hiding one until its prerequisites are met, or hiding its text until it is done, is
 * how an author writes a reveal. Every one of them is a presentation decision the client can make on
 * its own, because it already knows the dependency states and the task progress — so none of them
 * needed a change to the progression engine.
