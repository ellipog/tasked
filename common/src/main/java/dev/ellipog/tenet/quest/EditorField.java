/**
 * One field of a task or a reward, as the in-game editor draws it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is data rather than a screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>The editor used to describe an entry as a flat list of boxes: a name, a fixed width, four kinds. Every
 * type got the same treatment, so a dimension id, a statistic and an item id were all text fields of
 * roughly the same shape, and the fields that most needed to explain themselves -- an id you must know by
 * heart -- explained nothing. A number was a bare box with no unit, and a flag was a box that read
 * "Consume off".
 *
 * <p>A field now says what it <i>is</i> and how it should be edited, the type declares its own fields, and
 * the screen draws whatever it is handed. That is what makes a new task type a new <b>form</b> rather than
 * a new branch in the screen -- for this mod's types and for an addon's alike, which is the whole point:
 * the registration <i>is</i> the tailoring.
 *
 * <h2>Server-safe by construction</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Kind#SEARCH} names a list the screen should offer, not a class it should instantiate, and
 * {@link Source} is a short list of things a datapack can have. Nothing here mentions a client type, so a
 * task or reward type -- which lives on both sides -- can carry its editor without dragging the screen
 * into the server.
 *
 * <p>{@code path} is the field's path in the entry, which is what an edit commits to: {@code "count"}, or
 * {@code "position"} for a triple whose elements are {@code position.0} and so on.
 *
 * @param path    the field's path in the entry, as the tree spells it
 * @param label   the name the form shows beside the control
 * @param kind    how it is edited
 * @param unit    what a number counts -- {@code "×"}, {@code "blocks"}, {@code "mB"} -- or empty
 * @param hint    a sentence for a field whose meaning its label does not carry, or empty
 * @param options the allowed values of a {@link Kind#CHOICE}, in the order they cycle
 * @param source  which list a {@link Kind#SEARCH} searches
