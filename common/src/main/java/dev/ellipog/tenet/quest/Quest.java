 *   "title": "Punch a Tree",
 *   "description": ["Or don't. It's your world."],
 *   "icon": { "item": "minecraft:oak_log", "count": 1 },
 *   "x": 0, "y": 0,
 *   "tasks":  [ { "type": "tenet:item", "item": "minecraft:oak_log", "count": 8 } ],
 *   "rewards": [ { "type": "tenet:item", "item": "minecraft:wooden_axe", "count": 1 } ]
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The icon is an {@link Icon}: an item, a texture file, or an entity drawn as its egg. A bare
 * item object is the item arm, so every file written before the union reads unchanged.
 *
 * <h2>Three things here that FTB Quests does not have</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>{@code aliases}.</b> Progress is stored against a quest's id. Change the id — which every
 * author does, once, after realising {@code stoneage_quest_2} was a bad name — and every player
 * loses that quest. An alias list means the old id still resolves, so a rename costs nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code minRequired}.</b> The four {@link PrerequisiteMode} values cover the shapes anyone
 * actually wants, except one: "any three of these five". A count covers it, and setting it makes the
 * mode irrelevant.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code exclusiveGroup}.</b> FTB Quests has this too, so it is not a novelty — but it is
 * grouped into {@link QuestRules} here rather than being another top-level field competing for
 * attention with the quest's actual content.
 *
 * <p>Note {@code description} is a <i>list</i> of paragraphs. A single string with {@code \n} in it
 * is what FTB Quests takes, and it is the reason its quest descriptions end up as one
 * undifferentiated wall of text.
 *
 * <h2>Where the fields live</h2>
 *
 * <p>The flags are inside {@link QuestRules} because {@code RecordCodecBuilder} caps out at sixteen
 * components and this record has thirteen plus those fifteen. The accessors below delegate, so callers
 * write {@code quest.repeatable()} and never see the grouping.
