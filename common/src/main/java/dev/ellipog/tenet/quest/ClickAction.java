/**
 * What pressing an element does.
 *
 * <h2>The seven names are FTB's</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code click_action} in FTB Quests is one string, {@code "<type>:<data>"}, whose type is one of seven.
 * All seven are readable here, and all seven can be run: {@link Type#NONE}, {@link Type#OPEN_QUEST},
 * {@link Type#OPEN_URI}, {@link Type#SHOW_RECIPE}, {@link Type#SHOW_DOCS}, {@link Type#RUN_COMMAND} and
 * {@link Type#CUSTOM_EVENT}. The last two run on the server — a command through its dispatcher, an event
 * through the script bus — which is why the press crosses the wire as identity rather than as words.
 *
 * <p>Reading all seven is what makes a bad name reportable and precise: the value survives the decode, so
 * an unknown type is refused naming the seven there are — which tells an author their file came
 * from somewhere that meant something, and not what to do about it.
 *
 * <p>The honest alternative — keep the field, draw nothing when it is pressed — is rejected on the same
 * grounds T6 of the migration plan rejects it: a click that does nothing reads as a bug in the mod rather
 * than as a gap in it, and the author never finds out.
