/**
 * A player pressing a canvas element whose click the client cannot run itself.
 *
 * <h2>Identity only, like every other client-to-server press</h2>
 *
 * <p>The client sends which chapter and which element, and nothing else — never the command, never
 * the event id. The server reads the authoritative click from its own index, re-checks that it is
 * still a server-side action, and acts on that. A forged string would be a client choosing what the
 * server runs, which is the cheat vector {@link SubmitTaskPayload} exists to close: a payload that
 * carried a command would let a modified client point it at anything.
 *
 * <p>Both ids are bounded strings rather than free ones. A client can send anything, so the codec
 * refuses anything that could not be an id before it reaches a lookup.
 *
 * @param chapterId the chapter holding the element
 * @param elementId the element that was pressed
