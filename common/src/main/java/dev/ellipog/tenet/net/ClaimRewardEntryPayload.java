/**
 * One reward of a finished quest, collected on its own.
 *
 * <p>The rewards panel's per-row Claim, as against {@link ClaimRewardPayload}'s whole quest and
 * {@link ClaimAllPayload}'s whole book. Like every client-to-server payload here it is a request and
 * not a statement: the server re-resolves the quest and the index against its own files, and refuses
 * anything out of range, already collected, gated by an unmet condition, or held by the team's block.
 * A forged index therefore buys a modified client nothing — it can only ask for a reward it could
 * have pressed a button for.
 *
 * @param questId     the quest, by id or alias
 * @param rewardIndex which of its rewards is being collected
