/**
 * A client telling the server which language it is now reading in.
 *
 * <h2>Why this message has to exist</h2>
 *
 * <p>The server already knows a player's language when they connect: it arrives in the login handshake
 * and is readable as {@code ServerPlayer.clientInformation().language()}. What it cannot see is a
 * player who changes language <b>mid-session</b> — the option is applied on the client, and no loader
 * exposes a hook for it, so without a message from the client the book would keep the language the
 * player joined with until they reconnected.
 *
 * <p>It carries no content beyond the id: the server looks it up in the locales the pack actually
 * ships and answers with {@link LocaleSyncPayload}. A locale the pack has no file for is not an error
 * and not silence — it is answered with an empty overlay, which is what tells the client it is current
 * and stops it asking again.
 *
 * @param locale the client's selected language, normalised — never a path, only a map key
