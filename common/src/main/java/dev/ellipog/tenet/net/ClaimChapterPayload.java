/**
 * Every outstanding reward of one chapter, collected from the claim menu's banner.
 *
 * <p>The fourth rung of the same ladder: {@link ClaimRewardEntryPayload} is one reward,
 * {@link ClaimRewardPayload} one quest, this one a chapter, and {@link ClaimAllPayload} the whole book.
 * Like every client-to-server payload here it is a request and not a statement — the chapter is a
 * <b>scope</b>, not a list of quests, and the server resolves it against its own files and then applies
 * the same {@code canClaimFor} the single claim applies. A forged id therefore buys a modified client
 * nothing: it can name a chapter it could have pressed a button for, and that is all.
 *
 * <h2>Why a chapter id and not a filter, and why a payload and not a field</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ClaimAllPayload} carries a filter and deliberately nothing else, because a payload naming
 * quests would be a client deciding what it is owed. A chapter id does not break that rule — which of
 * its quests are owed stays the server's to decide — but it is a different question from "what kind of
 * reward", so it is a different message rather than a second field on one whose contract is already
 * stated as narrow.
 *
 * <h2>Why it carries the filter as well</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the menu's banner is drawn in a view, and the view can be *Choices pending*. A press that
 * reached past what the player can see would break the rule the whole card is built on — the footer's
 * sweep follows the view, so a banner's must too — and the first version of this payload did exactly
 * that: in the choices view, Claim Chapter handed over item rewards that were not on screen. The filter
 * only ever <b>narrows</b>: every reward it does reach is still checked against the stored progress, so
 * the worst a forged value can do is claim less than the player asked for.
 *
 * <p>There is no response payload of its own, exactly as for the other three: the outcome arrives as
 * the progress sync, and a sweep that stopped early as {@link ClaimSummaryPayload}.
 *
 * @param chapterId the chapter whose rewards are being collected, by id
 * @param filter    what the sweep is allowed to touch — the view the banner was pressed in
