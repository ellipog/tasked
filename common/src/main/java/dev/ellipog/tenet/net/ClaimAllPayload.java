/**
 * A player pressing the rewards panel's footer button.
 *
 * <h2>Why this carries a filter and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * <p>Which quests are owed is the server's to decide, exactly as it is for {@link ClaimRewardPayload}:
 * a payload naming quests would be a client deciding what it is owed, and {@code
 * ProgressService.claimAll} asks the same {@code canClaimFor} the single claim does rather than
 * trusting a list.
 *
 * <p>The one thing it does carry is the panel's active filter chip, because the footer button follows
 * it: "Claim items" while the list shows items must not reach past what the player can see. The filter
 * only narrows — every reward it does reach is validated against stored progress — so the worst a
 * modified client can do with it is claim less.
 *
 * <p>Like the single claim, there is no response payload of its own: the outcome arrives as the
 * progress sync and as {@link ClaimSummaryPayload}.
 *
 * @param filter what the sweep is allowed to touch
