/**
 * Turns the server's questline into the flat shape the client needs.
 *
 * <h2>Why a separate shape rather than sending the records</h2>
 *
 * <p>A client needs a title, an icon, a position, and what the tasks ask for. It does not need
 * dependencies as objects, codecs, or reward behaviours, and it cannot act on any of them. Sending
 * the records would put the addon API on both sides of the wire and mean a new task type broke the
 * client.
 *
 * <p>So this is a projection, written by hand, and the hand-writing is the point: it is the list of
 * what the client is allowed to know. Adding a field here is a decision about what crosses the wire,
 * which should not happen by accident because a record gained a component.
 *
 * <h2>The apostrophe problem, and why JSON is the right call for now</h2>
 *
 * <p>Text goes over as UTF-8 JSON. A hand-written binary encoding would be smaller — the plan says so
 * — but it would also be a second serialiser to keep in step, and a format nobody can read in a packet
 * dump while the shape is still moving. Binary is for a later stage, and the plan lists it there.

     * The version of the tree, as it goes over the wire.
     *
     * <h2>What 2 added, and the rule that keeps bumping it safe</h2>
     *
     * <p>Version 2 added {@code groups[]} at the root and {@code chapterGroupId} to every quest. Both
     * are <b>additions</b>: no field moved, no field was renamed, and every field a version-1 reader
     * asked for is still there meaning the same thing. That is the whole compatibility strategy, and it
     * is worth stating plainly because it is a constraint rather than a description — every future
     * change to {@link #treeAsJson} has to be of the additive kind, or be a deliberate break by a
     * reader that checks this number.
     *
     * <p>Version 3 added {@code chapters[]} at the root, for the same additive reason as the version
     * before it: it is the list of chapters themselves, which the per-quest fields could not carry for
     * a chapter that holds no quests yet. A version-2 reader ignores the array entirely and goes on
     * deriving its rows from the quests, which is what it already did.
     *
     * <p>Version 6 added the reward base mechanics to every reward — {@code auto}, {@code team} and
     * {@code excludeFromClaimAll}, resolved against the tree's settings — for the rewards panel. The
     * same additive kind: a version-5 reader draws its reward rows from the fields it knows and never
     * asks for the three.
     *
     * <p>Version 7 added the observation fields to a task that has them — {@code observeType},
     * {@code observeTarget}, {@code observeTicks} — which is what lets the client do the watching. A
     * version-6 reader ignores them and draws an observation task as a label, which is the honest
     * fallback: it cannot count what it cannot recognise.
     *
     * <p>Version 8 added a task's or a reward's {@code conditions} — the display sentence of each gate
     * it carries — and nothing else. Additive again: a version-7 reader draws the row without the
     * explanation, which is the honest fallback. Which rows are <i>locked</i> for a player does not
     * travel here at all; that is per-player state and lives on the progress channel, where every
     * per-player fact belongs.
     *
     * <p>Version 11 added the reward tables — {@code rewardTables} and {@code refusedTables} — which the
     * editor's browser lists and a reward's table badge draws. A version-10 reader ignores both. The
     * client pins this one by name, which is why it is here.
     *
     * <p>Version 12 added each chapter's own gate to {@code chapters[]} — {@code dependsOn},
     * {@code prerequisiteMode}, {@code minRequired} and {@code hideUntilDependenciesComplete} — plus the
     * chapter states on the progress channel, which is the other half of the same feature: the tree says
     * what a chapter waits for, and the progress message says how far it has got. Additive in the same
     * way as every bump before it: a version-11 reader reads the four fields it knows about a chapter and
     * draws every chapter exactly as it does today, which is the right fallback for a server that has
     * learned about chapter gates and a client that has not.
     *
     * <p>Version 13 added the <b>English half of every translatable text</b> — {@code titleFallback},
     * {@code subtitleFallback}, {@code chapterTitleFallback} and {@code descriptionFallbacks} — so a
     * client can tell a translation key from a literal and show the author's own words when nothing has
     * translated the key. A version-12 reader ignores them and draws what the field it does read holds,
     * which for a translatable text is the key: the same wrong string it drew before this version
     * existed, and the reason this bump is a fix rather than only a feature. The locale <i>overlay</i>
     * is deliberately not here at all — it travels on its own channel, to one player, because the tree
     * is broadcast and fifteen locales are not fifteen copies of the same questline. See
     * {@code LocaleSyncPayload}.
     *
     * <p>Version 14 added each chapter's canvas <b>{@code elements}</b> — the pictures, labels, lines and
     * boxes it draws behind its quests — to {@code chapters[]}, and only for a chapter that has any. The
     * same additive kind as every bump before it: a version-13 reader ignores the array and draws a
     * chapter with no decoration, which is a plainer picture rather than a wrong one. What is
     * deliberately <b>not</b> here is anything about an element's <i>state</i>, and the reason is the
     * whole design of the feature rather than a saving: an element holds no progress and gates nothing, so
     * there is no per-player fact about one to send and nothing for the progress channel to carry.
     *
     * <p>Version 15 added each chapter's <b>{@code links}</b> — the markers pointing at other quests —
     * beside the elements, and only for a chapter that has any. The same additive kind: a version-14
     * reader ignores the array and draws a chapter with no markers, which misses a shortcut rather
     * than a quest. What is deliberately <b>not</b> here, for the same reason as the elements, is a
     * link's <i>state</i>: a link mirrors its target quest, whose state already travels on the
     * progress channel, so sending it again would be a second answer that can disagree with the
     * first.
     *
     * <p>Version 16 added each quest's <b>{@code aliases}</b> — the former ids a renamed quest still
     * answers to — and only for a quest that has any. The same additive kind: a version-15 reader
     * ignores the array and resolves by id alone, which misses a pre-rename spelling rather than a
     * quest. What the client needs them for is the same lookups the server does, so an
     * {@code open_quest} press carrying an alias opens the quest instead of reporting a control
     * that does nothing.
     *
     * <p>Version 17 added the authoring flags — each quest's <b>{@code minWidth}</b>,
     * <b>{@code hideDependentLines}</b> and <b>{@code disableToast}</b>, each task's and each
     * reward's {@code disableToast}, each chapter's <b>{@code autofocus}</b>, and each reward
     * table's <b>{@code useTitle}</b> and <b>{@code hideTooltip}</b>. The same additive kind: a
     * version-16 reader ignores the keys and draws the old panel width, the old edges and the old
     * toasts, which is a plainer picture rather than a wrong one. {@code minWidth} travels
     * already resolved against the chapter's {@code defaultMinWidth}, like the reveal flags, so
     * the client reads one number and never a ladder.
     *
     * <p>Version 18 added each icon's <b>kind</b> — {@code iconKind} beside a quest's, a chapter's
     * (both the chapters[] copy and the per-quest copy), a group's and the book's icon — and each
     * task's and reward's <b>{@code textureIcon}</b>, the author's texture override. Absent kind
     * means the item arm, which is every icon a version-17 tree ever sent: a version-17 reader draws
     * a texture path or an entity id as a missing item, which names the picture it cannot draw rather
     * than drawing nothing. Components travel only on the item arm, because only an item has any.
     * An author item or egg travels in the display's own item, exactly as a type's would, so those
     * need no new key at all.
     *
     * <p>Version 19 added each item, item-tag and fluid task's <b>{@code manualOnly}</b> — FTB
     * Quests' {@code task_screen_only} under Tenet's name. Only when true: absence means the tick
     * measures, which is every task a version-18 tree ever sent. A version-18 reader draws the row
     * and withholds the button the way it withholds any press it cannot see coming, while the
     * server still accepts the press — the same direction every other additive key leans.
     *
     * <p><b>This list names the versions a reader branches on, not every bump.</b> Nine and ten added
     * nothing a client has to know and left no prose anywhere to reconstruct them from, so a rung for
     * each would be a history this file cannot support. {@link #TREE_VERSION} is the authority; this is
     * the map of the places it matters.
     *
     * <p>The consequence, in the direction that matters most: <b>an old client on a new server still
     * draws today's flat list.</b> It reads the fields it knows and ignores the two it does not, which
     * is what Gson does with a key nobody asks for, so an install that has not been updated keeps
     * working against a server that has.
     *
     * <h2>This is read in exactly one place, and deliberately not as a gate</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@link dev.ellipog.tenet.client.ClientQuestCache} compares it and logs a warning when the
     * server is ahead, and then reads the tree anyway. A reader that <i>refused</i> a version it did
     * not know would break the very case the additive design exists to keep working, so refusing is the
     * one thing this field must never be used for. It is a description of the tree and a diagnostic for
     * the mismatch; the field's presence and absence are what the reader actually branches on.
     *
     * <p>The reader importing this constant from the writer is a considered choice rather than an
     * oversight. The two classes are two halves of one hand-written contract — which is the whole point
     * of {@code QuestSyncTest} — so a second copy of this number in the client is precisely the "second
     * answer that can disagree" this codebase keeps finding. {@code net} and {@code client} already
     * reference each other, so this adds an instance of a coupling that is already there rather than a
     * new kind of one.

     * that <i>reads</i> a field nobody writes is strictly better than a client that has to be changed
     * on the day the writer arrives — the read path is exercised, the payload codec is exercised, and
     * the only edit left when the model gains the field is the one line below. What it must not become

     * moved, the entire tree crossed the wire to every member of the team — and the more content a pack

     *
     * <p>{@code previous == null} means a full sync, and that is the only way to get one. So the only
     * caller that can produce a full is one that has no snapshot, which is exactly the set of callers
     * that need one: a join, a reconnect, a reload, and a player whose party changed.
     *
     * <h2>What it costs, stated rather than implied</h2>
     *
     * <p>The <b>wire</b> shrinks and the <b>CPU does not</b>. Every quest is still serialised on every
     * call, because the serialised form is what the comparison is made of — there is no cheaper way to
     * ask "is this quest's resolved state different from what I sent" without keeping a parallel
     * structure of resolved states per player, and that structure would be a second description of the
     * same thing. So this is a bandwidth optimisation for large packs, not a general one, and
     * pretending otherwise would be the kind of claim that gets remembered wrongly.
     *
     * <h2>Removals are named, because absence cannot mean removed</h2>
     *
     * <p>A delta says "these quests are now thus". It cannot say "this quest is gone" by omitting it,
     * because omission is also what an unchanged quest looks like. So ids that were in the previous
     * snapshot and are not in the index are listed explicitly under {@code removed}, and the client
     * deletes them. Without it, a quest deleted from a file would live on in the client's cache until
     * the player reconnected — a ghost node on the canvas that cannot be clicked and cannot be
     * explained.

     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>No snapshot.</b> Nothing has been sent to this player since they joined, so there is
     *       nothing for a delta to be relative to.</li>
     *   <li><b>The reason says so.</b> A join or a reload is a request for the whole thing — the
     *       client has cleared, or the tree under it has changed.</li>
     *   <li><b>The team changed.</b> A player who left a party has a client holding the previous
     *       team's progress. A delta would merge one party's questline onto another's, which produces
     *       a cache that is a mixture of two and looks like neither.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The team check is why the snapshot stores the team id rather than only the quests: a party
     * change is not an event this class is told about, and it does not need to be, because the next
     * call can see it by comparison.

     *
     * <p>The stage gate's lock is computed when progress is sent, and that is enough for a gate whose
     * input a command changes — the command sends. A condition's inputs are the world: an inventory, a
     * score, an advancement, who is online. Picking up the last log unlocks a row with no progress
     * event to carry the news, so a picture computed only at send time would go on saying locked until
     * something unrelated happened.
     *
     * <p>So the tick re-asks, once a second, and sends only when the canonical picture differs from
     * what this player was last sent — a picture that has not changed costs nothing on the wire, and
     * the idle-tick invariant survives. The whole pass is skipped when no quest declares a condition,
     * which is what keeps it free for the packs that do not use them.
     *
     * <p>Called from the player-tick hook, which runs per player per tick, so the guard is a
     * comparison against the game time rather than a counter — a counter would tick twice as fast with
     * two players online. A clock that has gone backwards is due, the same rule {@code isDue} follows
     * for the same reason: game time is per-world while this state lives for the life of the process.
