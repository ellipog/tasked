/**
 * A reward table's file, whole, on its way to a client that asked for it.
 *
 * <h2>Why the text rather than a decoded table</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same argument {@link ChapterReplicaPayload} makes for a chapter: the client's copy is a copy
 * rather than a translation. A table written by a newer build, or one holding a reward type this build
 * has never heard of, is still something an author should be able to look at — and an editor that
 * re-encoded what it was sent would silently drop the fields it did not understand.
 *
 * <p>The file cap is the chapter payload's, for the same measured reason: {@code
 * ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket.MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE} is 1048576 bytes in this version, and a table is a
 * few kilobytes. A pack that somehow exceeds it gets a refusal rather than a truncated table, because
 * the codec's limit is the check.
 *
 * @param table the table's id
 * @param json  the file's own text, or empty when it could not be read
 * @param usedBy who still points at this table — a quest, or another table file
