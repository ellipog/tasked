/**
 * The stages one player has, sent to that player's own client.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not on the progress payload</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two reasons, and either alone would decide it. The progress payload is a flat record already at the
 * six components a {@code StreamCodec.composite} allows, so there is no room for a seventh. And its body is
 * a per-quest delta -- each quest compared as encoded text against the last sync -- which has no notion of
 * a root-level fact that changes on its own; a stage granted in a script would ride nothing and be seen only
 * at the next full sync.
 *
 * <p>So stages travel on their own, like the roster and the world's dimension list: sent on join with
 * everything else, and re-sent whenever they change. Ids, sorted, so two arrivals cannot reorder a list a
 * script is walking.
