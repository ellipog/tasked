/**
 * The lists the editor searches that this server has, sent to a client so the pickers can offer them.
 *
 * <h2>The rule this payload exists to keep</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A list may only be read from a registry the client is sent.</b> A client's registry access is
 * two layers — the static registries the game builds at startup, and the ones the server sends on join —
 * and 1.21.1 sends eleven of them: the biomes, the chat types, the trim patterns and materials, the wolf
 * and painting variants, the dimension types, the damage types, the banner patterns, the enchantments and
 * the jukebox songs. Everything else a datapack defines — a structure, a structure set, a placed feature,
 * a level stem — is on the server and nowhere else on a client, in single player as much as on a dedicated
 * server, because the client half of single player is still a client with a connection to talk over.
 *
 * <p>Reading one of those from {@code minecraft.level.registryAccess()} does not throw. It answers an
 * empty registry, so the picker opens with no rows and looks like a field nothing can fill — which is
 * exactly how the structure list shipped. The alternatives to this payload are both worse: a hardcoded
 * vanilla list would be a lie about a pack's own structures, and a text box is a quiz rather than an
 * editor.
 *
 * <h2>What is in it, and why nothing more</h2>
 *
 * <p>Ids only, and a tag as {@code #namespace:path} — the two spellings a {@code RegistryRef} field takes.
 * A list carries no icon and no name a data-driven client can render beyond its id, so a payload carrying
 * more would be carrying a copy of something the client would prettify anyway.
 *
 * <p>Sent on join, with the tree and the roster. A list added by a datapack reload arrives on the next
 * join rather than mid-session, which is the same deal the tree makes and worth knowing rather than
 * discovering.
