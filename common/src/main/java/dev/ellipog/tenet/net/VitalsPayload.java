/**
 * An operator's client being told whether to draw the frame rate.
 *
 * <h2>Why this travels at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the switch has to be an operator's, and the drawing is the client's. Vanilla has no client
 * command, so {@code /tenet vitals} is a server command — which is also the only place an ops check can
 * live, since a client asking for it is not an authority on whether it may. The server decides, and this
 * carries the answer to the one client that asked. One boolean, no chunking and no revision: it is a
 * preference, not content.
 *
 * @param on whether that player's client should draw the vitals overlay
