/**
 * What the reload found wrong, pushed to the authors who are editing.
 *
 * <h2>The faults nothing else can see</h2>
 *
 * <p>The per-file validator runs inside {@code QuestEditor.save} and refuses a file the loader would reject —
 * but it only ever sees <b>one file at a time</b>. Three faults are therefore invisible to it and were written
 * silently, with only the server log knowing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a {@code dependsOn} naming a quest that is not in the pack;</li>
 *   <li>a cycle between quests in different files;</li>
 *   <li>an id declared in two chapters.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each is a fault of the <i>pack</i> rather than of a file, so it can only be found by the index that reads
 * them all — which is the reload's own work. The author who caused one saw their edit succeed and nothing else,
 * and the quest was then quietly absent from the tree or unreachable.
 *
 * <h2>Why this arrives after the reply rather than with it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because it cannot arrive with it. An edit is applied and answered <b>synchronously</b>, and the reload is
 * coalesced to one per server tick — so at the moment the reply is written the pack has not been re-read and
 * the cross-file faults do not exist yet as an answer. Attaching them to the reply would mean either reloading
 * per op, which is the coalescing this codebase deliberately added, or reporting the <i>previous</i> reload's
 * faults, which is a message about a state the author has already changed.
 *
 * <p>So the reply stays what it is — "your edit was applied and written" — and this carries the separate fact,
 * as soon as it is knowable.
 *
 * @param lines how many problems there are, so a truncated list can say what it is not showing
 * @param text  the problems, one per line, as {@code DataProblem.renderWithPath} wrote them, or "" for none

     * <h2>Why the rendering lives here and not at the send site</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because it is the payload's own shape: the count and the lines are two fields of this record, and
     * the rule that keeps them consistent — the count is how many there <i>are</i>, the text is as many as
     * fit — is a fact about this message rather than about the network layer that sends it. It was inline in
     * {@code TenetNetworking}, where two senders would each have needed a copy and where no test could
     * reach it; here the truncation and the count are asserted directly.
     *
     * <p>Null rather than an empty payload, because "nothing is wrong" is not a message. Both callers want
     * to send nothing at all in that case — one to every player, one to a player arriving — and returning a
     * payload of zero lines would put a report about nothing on the screen of everyone who joins a healthy
     * server.
