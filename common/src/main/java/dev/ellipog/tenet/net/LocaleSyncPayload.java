/**
 * One locale's quest text, sent to the one player who asked for it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not on the tree</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the tree is <b>broadcast</b> and a locale is not. Every player is sent the same questline
 * — that is what makes one encode serve everybody — and putting fifteen locales on it would send every
 * player fourteen they cannot read, on the message that is already the largest one the mod sends. The
 * tree carries the canonical strings and this carries the overlay, to one player, on its own channel.
 *
 * <h2>Why it carries two locale ids</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code locale} is what the player asked for — the language their client is set to, or what the
 * server read from the login handshake. {@code served} is the file the server actually used, which may
 * be a relative of it: an {@code es_mx} player reading a pack with only {@code es_es.json} is served
 * {@code es_es}. See {@code QuestLanguages.servedLocale}.
 *
 * <p>Both travel because the client has to compare the right one. It settles on {@code locale} — the
 * language it actually has selected — so a player served a regional relative is not left asking again
 * forever for a locale the pack was never going to have. {@code served} is the answer to "what am I
 * reading", which is worth being able to say.
 *
 * <h2>An empty overlay is a real message</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is sent even when the pack has no file for the locale, and that is not a wasted packet: it is
 * how the client learns it is current, and it is what <b>clears</b> a locale the player has just
 * switched away from. Without it, moving from Spanish to a language the pack does not translate would
 * leave the Spanish text on screen.
 *
 * @param locale what the player asked for, normalised
 * @param served the locale actually used, or empty when the pack has none for it
 * @param chunk  where this chunk sits in the message
 * @param data   this chunk's packed bytes — see {@link SyncWire#pack}
