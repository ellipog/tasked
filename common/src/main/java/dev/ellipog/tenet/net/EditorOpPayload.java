/**
 * One edit, from a client that wants it to a server that decides.
 *
 * <h2>A request, like every other payload here</h2>
 *
 * <p>It carries the chapter and the operation and <b>no authority at all</b>: the server checks the sender's
 * permission, opens its own model of that chapter and applies the op to <i>its</i> files. A modified client
 * can send any op it likes and gets exactly what an honest one gets — a refusal unless it may edit — which is
 * the property the design's "the server is the authority" line is for.
 *
 * <p>The op travels as JSON text written by {@link dev.ellipog.tenet.editor.EditorOps}, which is the same
 * code that reads it back: the two ends cannot disagree about what an op is, because there is one description
 * of it in the mod and this payload only carries the bytes.
 *
 * @param chapter   the chapter's id, as the loader names it
 * @param op        the operation, as {@code EditorOps.write} produced it
 * @param requestId which request this is, echoed in the reply, or <b>0</b> when the caller has none
