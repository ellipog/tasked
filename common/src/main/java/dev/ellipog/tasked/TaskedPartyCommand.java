/**
 * {@code /tasked party} — the party commands, on Armature's teams.
 *
 * <h2>This wraps; it does not implement</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every mutation below is one call to {@link TeamManager}: create, invite, accept, leave, kick,
 * disband. There is no membership logic in this file and there must not be — the whole reason teams
 * live in Armature is that membership is the general primitive, and a second implementation of
 * "who is in the party" here is how the party panel and the party commands come to disagree.
 *
 * <p>What this file adds is the three things a command has and an API does not: a permission
 * question, a player-facing message, and <b>telling the clients</b>.
 *
 * <h2>The source may not be ours, and that is the ordinary case rather than an edge case</h2>
 *
 * <p>A server running FTB Teams or Open Parties and Claims already has parties, and
 * {@link Teams#of} resolves to whichever of them it is. So:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A read-only source refuses loudly.</b> {@code TeamManager}'s mutators throw by default so
 *       that a source which cannot write says so instead of silently doing nothing — but a command
 *       that let that exception escape would present a library's exception as a crash. So every
 *       mutating subcommand asks {@link TeamManager#managesMembership()} first and, when the answer
 *       is no, says which source owns the parties on this server and where to go instead. That is
 *       strictly more useful than the exception, because it names the mod.</li>
 *   <li><b>A silent source needs the push, because nothing else will make it.</b> See
 *       {@link #pushMembershipChange}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The mode is not gated on any of that</b>, and the distinction is worth stating because it
 * looks like an oversight. A {@link PartyMode} is not membership — it is a rule about how
 * <i>quest</i> counts combine, it lives in Tasked's own store, and it is readable and writable on a
 * server whose parties are entirely somebody else's. So {@code /tasked party mode} works everywhere,
 * including on the one server where {@code /tasked party create} has to refuse.
 *
 * <h2>Why promises here are not gated on operator permission</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because none of this is an operator's business. Creating a party, inviting somebody and leaving
 * are things a player does for themselves, and their authority over other players is checked by
 * Armature — {@code kick} refuses an actor who does not outrank the target, and {@code disband}
 * refuses anybody but the owner. Putting an op gate on top would mean a player cannot leave a party
 * without asking an admin, which is the sort of rule that gets a mod uninstalled.

     *
     * <p>A source that fires events ({@link TeamManager#firesEvents()} is true) announces its own
     * membership changes, and Tasked's listener on those events does the pushing. A source that does
     * not is one where this is the only chance anybody gets — a party changed and Armature was not
     * told. When both fired, every member would receive two full syncs for one change, and the
     * message count is exactly what the playthrough asserts on, so the duplication would be a failing
     * test rather than a shrug.
     *
     * <p>The condition is read off the interface rather than guessed from the source's name, so it
     * cannot go stale: FTB Teams bridges its party events and answers true, Open Parties and Claims
     * offers no party event to bridge and answers false, and this does the right thing for each
     * without naming either.
     *
     * <h2>The audience, and why it is a union</h2>
     *
     * <p>"The people who were in it" and "the people who are in it" are different sets, and a
     * membership change moves progress for both: the members who remain are now sharing with one more
     * or one fewer player, and the player who moved has had their progress owner change under them.
     * A caller that pushed to only the team as it now is would leave the leaver stale — which is the
     * same fault {@code sendTeamChange}'s {@code alsoThis} parameter exists for, at the other end.
     *
     * <p>So a caller passes the membership <b>before</b> and <b>after</b>, and the player, and this
     * works out the rest. Both are needed at the call sites anyway to describe what the command did,
     * and computing them there is what keeps this from having to ask "what changed" after the fact —
     * a question whose answer is already gone by then.
