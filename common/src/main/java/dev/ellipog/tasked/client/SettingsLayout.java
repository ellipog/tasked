/**
 * The settings card's rows, composed without a client.
 *
 * <h2>What is on this card, and what deliberately is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>The card holds the rows about <b>this player's own view</b>: how large the text draws, and where their
 * HUD things sit. The look is the pack's — a theme list, a radius and a follow-the-pack row sat here once and
 * moved to the tools panel, where an author edits colours — and Motion is a switch in that same panel,
 * beside the other mode switches. What a player is owed on this card is what is about their own eyes and
 * their own screen rather than about the book's appearance, and a placed button is the second of those.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class</h2>
 *
 * <p>The composition is arithmetic over the values {@code Look} reports, so it lives here where it can be
 * asserted without a screen, and the screen turns an entry into a widget. It was written with one row and its
 * note said the shape was kept because "the row list is what a test can hold and what a second row would
 * join"; the HUD row is that second row, and it joined without this class changing shape.
 *
 * <h2>Why the label is a {@code Component}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because it was a bare string and only English ever saw it: the first row read {@code "Text size"} in
 * every language, and the translated text a player did see was the slider's own message beside it. A
 * component is what the screen draws and what a translator can reach, and the one existing row is unchanged
 * from the player's side by being wrapped rather than rewritten.
