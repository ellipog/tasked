/**
 * The seam's entry point: where a mod with quests hands its content in, and where the tick lives
 * that keeps it current and lets the one static viewer catch up.
 *
 * <h2>Who calls what</h2>
 *
 * <p>The content side calls {@link #install} once from the client initialiser. The loaders call
 * {@link #tick()} once per client tick; it forwards to the content so it can notice its own world
 * changing, then to the chosen adapter if it needs a tick of its own. Everything else -- registering
 * categories, drawing a page, deciding to reload -- happens inside a viewer's own discovery of
 * this mod's plugin class, and that class asks {@link Viewers#mayInstall} first.
 *
 * <h2>The ticker list and the class-loading rule</h2>
 *
 * <p>A ticker entry names a <i>holder</i> class, never a viewer's plugin class: a compile-time
 * {@code MOD_ID} constant for the probe, a supplier for the factory so the holder is not loaded
 * before it is asked for, and the instance field typed as {@link ViewerAdapter} so resolving the
 * field needs no viewer type either. That is the same three-part arrangement a soft adapter uses,
 * and it is the difference between "a client without EMI loses nothing" and a
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError} at construction. The list is hand-written and ordered like
 * {@link Viewers.Viewer}; it starts empty because the first adapter that needs a tick adds its own
 * entry (EMI does -- its registration is static, so it is the one viewer with a tick to run).
