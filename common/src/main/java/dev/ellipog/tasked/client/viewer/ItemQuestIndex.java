/**
 * Which quests use an item, which award it, and which do either -- the one thing every viewer asks.
 *
 * <p>All three viewers find an item's page through their own ingredient index, so why does this exist?
 * Because the index they build is of <i>pages</i>, and a page is only registered for the quests a
 * viewer knows about: EMI registers them in one batch on a worker thread, and JEI and REI generate
 * them at lookup time. Every one of those paths needs the same answer -- "which quests, in what
 * order, and in which role" -- and three implementations of that walk would be three places for the
 * snapshot to be read wrongly.
 *
 * <p>Two roles, kept apart rather than merged into a boolean, because a viewer words them
 * differently: an item under <i>uses</i> is a task, under <i>recipes</i> a reward. A quest that both
 * uses and awards one item appears once in {@link #questsFor} -- required first -- so a lookup never
 * shows the same quest twice.
 *
 * <p>Built by the content side (it has the quest data) and read by the adapters (they have the
 * viewers). The builder is the only mutable part; a built index is immutable and safe to read from
 * any thread, which is the property EMI's registration depends on.
