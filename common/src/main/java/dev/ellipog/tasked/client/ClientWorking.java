/**
 * Where the author was: the last table opened, the drawer's tab, the Assets panel's section.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a third settings file rather than a field on the screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because it has to outlive the screen, and the screen is rebuilt on every resize, every reload and
 * every overlay — a field on it would be a memory that forgets the moment anything happens. It is the
 * same shape as {@link DevMode} and {@link ClientAppearance} deliberately: one file, read by the same two
 * lines of each loader's client initialiser, written when a value changes.
 *
 * <h2>What these values are not</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>They are hints, not state.</b> None of them decides what is on screen; each one decides what is
 * highlighted, sorted first, or selected when a panel opens. That distinction is what makes a stale file
 * harmless: the last table may have been deleted, or belong to a different world on the same client —
 * because this file is per client, not per world — and in either case the panel opens on its list with
 * nothing highlighted rather than on a file that is not there.
 *
 * <p>So every reader asks "is this value still true" before using it. A value that is written and never
 * checked is the fault this note exists to prevent.
