/**
 * The claim menu's composition: chapter banners, the quests under them, the rewards under those, and
 * the three columns every row is read in.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a layout and not a panel</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same reason every other list in this codebase is one: everything worth being wrong about is
 * arithmetic on integers — does a reward row indent under the right header, does a row's action fit its
 * row, does a collapsed chapter contribute only its banner, and do two rows' reward columns share one
 * vertical axis — and arithmetic is the thing the tests can hold without a client. The screen takes a
 * {@link Layout} from here and asks it where each row and each column went; the drawing and the presses
 * are the screen's, because neither can happen without a game.
 *
 * <h2>The accordion, as rows rather than as a widget tree</h2>
 *
 * <p>A collapsed chapter is a caller that built its row list without that chapter's quests, and a
 * collapsed quest is one that left out its rewards — the same fold {@code QuestPanelLayout} uses for
 * its sections, and the reason the gaps go <i>before</i> each row: a fold leaves no stray gap where the
 * folded rows used to be. Expansion state is the caller's, never stored here, so a rebuild for a scroll
 * or a resize cannot lose it.
 *
 * <h2>The three columns, and why they are derived from the right edge</h2>
 *
 * <p>A reward row is indented under its quest, so a column taken from the row's <i>left</i> edge would
 * shift with the indent — and "the reward icons line up down the page" is the whole point of having
 * columns at all. Every row's right edge is the same (the indent narrows the left edge and nothing
 * else, which {@code RewardInboxLayoutTest} asserts), so the action and reward columns are measured
 * back from it and hold one axis across indented and unindented rows alike. Only the context column
 * moves with the indent, which is what makes an indented row read as indented.
 *
 * <p>{@link #column} keeps the row's own key on every cell, so a hit test on a column names the row it
 * belongs to rather than a rectangle — the same contract {@link #body} has.
