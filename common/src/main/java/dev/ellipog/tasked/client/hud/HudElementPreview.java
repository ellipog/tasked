/**
 * One element in the editor: the thing you grab, and the thing that shows what it will look like.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is the real control rather than a picture of one</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a picture is a second description of an appearance, which is exactly the fault the toolkit's
 * control table exists to prevent: the outside-the-game preview once drew a selected row hover-coloured
 * while the screen drew it flat, and the invented one is the one people looked at. This extends
 * {@link ArmatureButton}, so the preview <i>is</i> the control -- the same fills, the same edge, the same
 * icon box -- and the ring around it is the only thing added. Nothing here knows what a button looks like.
 *
 * <h2>Why the drag needs no help from the screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because this is a widget on <b>our own</b> screen. A container screen drops releases and drags -- the
 * reason the real button opens on press and why the last plan needed a clock to notice a release at all --
 * but {@code Screen} focuses the child that consumed a press, and {@code ContainerEventHandler} then hands
 * that child every drag and the release. So moving an element is the ordinary widget path, and the only
 * thing the screen does is decide where a resting element draws.
 *
 * <h2>Why the drag reads the pointer rather than the movement</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the movement arrives rounded. The game calls {@code MouseHandler.handleAccumulatedMovement}
 * once per frame with the whole frame's mouse delta in GUI pixels -- a fraction -- and adding its rounded
 * value to the position loses that fraction every frame: the element trails the cursor by up to half a
 * pixel a frame, and at a GUI scale of two or more a slow drag rounds to nothing at all and the element
 * sits still while the cursor moves. So the press records where inside the element it took hold, and every
 * drag is that one subtraction against the pointer; see {@link HudLayout#dragged}. Nothing accumulates,
 * so nothing drifts.
