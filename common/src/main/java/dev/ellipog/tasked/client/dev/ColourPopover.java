/**
 * The floating colour picker: a saturation/value box, two tracks, a hex field and three channel fields.
 *
 * <h2>An overlay, not a band</h2>
 *
 * <p>It replaces the docked colour footer -- a swatch line, four channel steppers and a permanent hex
 * field, all of which were spent on one colour at a time whether or not anybody was editing one. This
 * opens from the chip on the row the colour belongs to, sits to the left of the drawer (over the canvas,
 * where nothing can be underneath it to steal its presses), and closes when the edit is done.
 *
 * <h2>One commit per gesture, on the same terms as every other control</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #preview} is called as the pointer moves -- the canvas follows the drag before anything is
 * written -- and {@link #commit} once per released gesture, and once more on close if the last change was
 * not written yet. Both are the screen's: the popover does not know whether the target is a chapter's
 * patch or the player's own theme, and it must not.
 *
 * <h2>The fields are widgets; the picker is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>The hex box and the three channel fields are {@code ArmatureTextField} and {@code ScrubField}, because
 * typing and scrubbing are what those already do; the screen adds them while the popover is open and
 * removes them when it closes ({@link #widgets()}). The picker's own surface, tracks, swatches and markers
 * are drawn here, and their presses are hit-tested here -- one rectangle per part, derived once.
