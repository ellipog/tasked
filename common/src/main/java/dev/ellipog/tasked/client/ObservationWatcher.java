/**
 * Watches the crosshair for observation tasks and submits when one has been looked at long enough.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is the client's job, and the only one</h2>
 *
 * <p>A server never sees where a player is looking, so an observation task can only be judged where
 * the eyes are. FTB Quests does the same thing, and the trust is deliberate and bounded: the worst a
 * modified client can do is finish an observation without watching, which grants nothing by itself.
 * Everything a payout depends on is still decided server-side.
 *
 * <p>Called once per client tick from each loader's tick hook — the only two seams that exist, since
 * Armature has no client-tick event. The counters are per session and in memory: what the server keeps
 * is the completed task, recorded in the ordinary progress record.
 *
 * <h2>What the tick walks, and what it used to</h2>
 *
 * <p>It used to walk <b>every quest and every task in the book</b>, every tick, to find the handful of
 * tasks that can be observed at all — and it did that with no screen open, which is to say it was paid
 * by a player who was mining. The cost scaled with the size of the pack and bought nothing: a task's
 * <i>kind</i> cannot change unless the tree does, so most of the walk asked a question whose answer had
 * not moved since the last reload.
 *
 * <p>So the tasks that can be observed are gathered once per tree revision and the tick walks that
 * list. Two things about the split are load-bearing rather than tidiness:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The list holds only what the tree can move</b> — where the task is, what to watch, and for
 *       how long. Everything about <i>this player right now</i> — finished, already counted, or shut by
 *       a condition — stays in the tick, where it is read as it always was.</li>
 *   <li><b>It is keyed on the tree revision and not on progress</b>, and that follows from the point
 *       above: a list holding no per-player fact has no reason to be rebuilt when a player's progress
 *       moves. Keying it on both would rebuild it on every progress message — which is a whole-book
 *       walk per message, most of the cost this exists to remove, arriving by a different road.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The invariant that makes that safe: <b>this list is never more stale than the state the tick reads
 * beside it.</b> The per-player reads ({@code taskLockOf} and its neighbours) come from the same cache
 * the list's own contents do, and the tick asks them fresh every time — so a task whose stage or
 * condition changed is judged by the current answer, exactly as before, whatever the list holds.
