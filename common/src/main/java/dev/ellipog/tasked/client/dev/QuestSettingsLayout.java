/**
 * The quest settings page's arithmetic: the frame, the rows, the swatch grid, and the sliders.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class and not the screen's own sums</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because everything worth being wrong about here is arithmetic on integers — does a swatch's
 * rectangle contain the point the press landed on, does a slider's knob sit where the value says, does
 * the page still lay out when the window is small enough for the card to be at its minimum — and
 * arithmetic on integers is the thing this project's tests can hold without a client. The screen draws
 * what this says and asks it where the controls are; the drawing itself is {@code QuestSettingsPanel}'s.
 *
 * <h2>One derivation for the drawing and the press</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #cellRect} is how a swatch is drawn and {@link #cellAt} is how it is pressed, and the second
 * is defined in terms of the first's arithmetic rather than beside it. A grid drawn at one spacing and
 * hit at another is a grid an author cannot aim at, and the failure reads as a broken mouse rather than
 * as arithmetic — which is the same argument the item picker's rows and the tools panel's hotspots are
 * built on.
 *
 * <h2>What the page is</h2>
 *
 * <p>A live preview on the left, a column of controls on the right that scrolls when it does not fit,
 * and a line at the bottom that says what the control under the pointer is for. The rows come from
 * {@link #rows()} in one list, so the drawing, the widgets and the hit tests cannot disagree about what
 * the page contains — which is the fault {@code QuestPanelLayout} exists to prevent for the inspector.
