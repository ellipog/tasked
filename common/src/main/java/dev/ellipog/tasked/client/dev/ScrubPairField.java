/**
 * Two controls sharing one row, for the scalar pairs the panel would otherwise spend a band each on.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists rather than two widgets</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because of how a row is placed. The list is a {@code ScrollView}: a row's rectangle is found by its
 * key, and one key places one widget — the scroll, the clip and the "hide a half-scrolled row" rule all
 * read that one rectangle. Two widgets stacked at the same y would mean a second placement path that
 * could disagree with the first about where the row is, which is the class of fault this codebase writes
 * comments about. So the row is one widget and the two halves are its children: they are positioned from
 * the row's own bounds, and they are never added to the screen themselves.
 *
 * <h2>What the children keep</h2>
 *
 * <p>Everything: the pair forwards the pointer to whichever half was pressed and the keyboard to whichever
 * half has the caret, and blurs the other when focus moves. A half that was never pressed answers
 * nothing, which is what makes a press on the row's label area fall through to the screen — labels are
 * drawn by the panel, and a label press that becomes a drag is the screen's gesture to route (see
 * {@link ScrubField#beginLabelScrub}).
