/**
 * A renderer that counts what it forwards — the instrument the canvas's cost is read from.
 *
 * <h2>Why a counter rather than an argument</h2>
 *
 * <p>The canvas's slowness was one fact: every {@code fill} is its own GPU batch submission, and a
 * chapter of curved lines issues one fill per screen pixel of ink. That is a claim about a <b>number</b>,
 * and the honest way to check a claim about a number is to read the number — not to argue it from the
 * code and then ask a player whether the game feels better.
 *
 * <p>So this wraps the real renderer when the dev mode is on, counts the frame, and logs a line a
 * second: fills, labels, icons, textures and batched regions. Before the batching work a chapter of curves reads
 * in the tens of thousands of fills; with it, the same fills arrive in one batched region per frame,
 * which is the number that matters — the fills still exist, the <i>submissions</i> do not.
 *
 * <h2>Widths, and why they are counted</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because measuring text is the other half of what a frame costs, and the fill count cannot see it:
 * every truncated label measures its own string once per character, and a card that re-wraps its prose
 * measures every line of it again. {@code widths} is that number — a proxy, and the honest one this
 * seam can offer, because it can see the ask and not the font call behind it. It is what says whether a
 * measurement cache would have anything to hit.
 *
 * <h2>Flushes, and the submission count that used not to be visible from here</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code flushes} counts the calls this seam makes to {@link GuiRenderer#flush} — the canvas's own
 * drain, and the blur when a modal is open. <b>That is all it counts, and the number is small: one or
 * two on an ordinary frame.</b> It is not the submission count and must not be read as one. Every
 * {@code fill}'s own flush happens inside {@code GuiGraphics}, below this interface, and so does every
 * render-type change — a label, an icon, a texture — which ends a batch just as surely.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code switches} is that submission count, and it is the reason this class exists in its current
 * shape.</b> It counts the points at which the drawing has to stop being one batch and become another:
 * a change of render type (a fill after a label, a label after an icon), a clip, and a flush. That is
 * what a frame costs on the CPU side, because each of those ends a {@code endBatch} and starts a new
 * one with its own state setup — and it is the number that a batching change has to move. It counts
 * every drawing call in the frame, batched or not, which is why it is meaningful before and after: the
 * <i>fills</i> are the same either way, and the <i>boundaries</i> are not.
 *
 * <p>It undercounts two things, both deliberately: the extra passes inside {@code renderItem} (an item
 * with a glint or a translucent layer submits more than once, and that is below this interface), and
 * the second scissor change a clip makes when it closes. Both mean the real figure is a little higher
 * than this — which is the honest direction for a proxy to be wrong in, since the claim it supports is
 * that the frame submits far too many times.
 *
 * <p>It is a decorator rather than a second implementation, and it counts in the same call that draws,
 * so nothing can be drawn without being counted. Off, it costs one branch at the call site that builds
 * the renderer.

     * merely built. Appending a ratio to a list of counts invites it to be read as one.
     *
     * <p>And it is the number that would have caught the fault this project already had once: a plan table
     * keyed on a shape's identity, with {@code inner()} returning a fresh object per call, so every entry
     * was built and then unreachable. Every count on the frame line was <i>correct</i> while that was true,
     * and so were the pixels. A ratio near zero is the only thing that says it.
     *

     * otherwise get a line saying nothing, which reads as a measurement of zero rather than as an absence.
