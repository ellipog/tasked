/**
 * How much of the quest cache the client walked this second — the instrument the per-tick cost is read
 * from.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not on the frame HUD</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the walks it counts happen when <b>no screen is open</b>, which is the whole reason they
 * matter: a tick that walks every quest every tick is paid by a player who is mining, not by a player
 * reading the book. {@link CountingRenderer}'s HUD can only draw while the book is up, so a walk count
 * that lived there would be blind to exactly the cost it was added to prove. This reports to the log
 * instead, once a second, whether or not anything is on screen.
 *
 * <h2>What the number is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not for tuning. It is the <b>falsifier</b> for a claim of the form "this tick no longer walks the
 * cache": iterations proportional to the quest or task count are the defect, and the fix is to walk a
 * handful of relevant rows instead. A count that stays flat as the quest count grows is the proof; a
 * count that scales with the pack is the defect, still there. That is a claim about a number, so the
 * honest way to settle it is to print the number.
 *
 * <h2>Off, and what it costs when off</h2>
 *
 * <p>One branch per walker. {@link DevMode#on()} is a static boolean read, and a walker that asks while
 * the mode is off allocates nothing, looks nothing up and logs nothing — so this can sit in a tick path
 * without a second thought about the cost of the instrument itself.
 *
 * <h2>The tally, and the thread it is written on</h2>
 *
 * <p>A plain map rather than a concurrent one, because every caller is the client thread: the tick
 * hook that drives them runs there, and there is no version of "the walk happened somewhere else" that
 * would not also be a bug worth a crash. The boxed per-call allocation a {@code Map.merge} would make
 * is avoided too — the value is an {@code int[]} so a call is a lookup and an add.
