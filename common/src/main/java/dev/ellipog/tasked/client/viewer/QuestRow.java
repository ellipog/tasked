/**
 * One line of a quest page: a task to hand in or a reward to claim.
 *
 * <p>The record is both the static shape and the live reading. A snapshot built when the tree arrives
 * fills in the label, the icon and {@code need}, and leaves {@code have} at zero; the same type comes
 * back from {@link QuestContent#liveTask} with the numbers as they are now. That is on purpose: a
 * viewer lays a page out once from the snapshot and redraws its numbers from the live call, so a
 * progress tick never has to rebuild anything.
 *
 * <p>{@code label} is already the player's language -- the content side owns every word, because the
 * words belong to the quest file's author and its translators, not to a viewer adapter.
 *
 * <p>{@code tagId} is {@code namespace:path} when the row names an item tag, empty otherwise, and
 * {@code icon} is empty in that case. It stays a string so this record carries no item-registry
 * knowledge; an adapter turns it into whatever its viewer calls a tag, once per page build rather
 * than once per frame.
 *
 * <p>{@code sourceIndex} is the row's position in the content's own list — the index
 * {@link QuestContent#liveTask} and {@link QuestContent#liveReward} expect. A page's rows are the
 * item-referencing subset of that list, so a page index is <i>not</i> a source index, and an adapter
 * that asked for live numbers by page position would read the wrong row (or none).
 *
 * <p>{@code claimable} is a reward's "ready to collect" — finished quest, conditions met, not yet
 * claimed. It is false on every task row, which has progress instead.
