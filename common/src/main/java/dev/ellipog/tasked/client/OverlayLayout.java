/**
 * How the quest overlay's body stacks up: a description, a task list, a reward list, and what the
 * quest requires.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, and what it is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is the <i>particular</i> composition of one screen's reading pane — three headings, an empty
 * state under each, and a row per entry. It is not a layout engine: the stacking itself is
 * {@link Stack}'s, in Armature, and this is a caller of it. The split is worth keeping because the
 * generic half is what a second screen can reuse, and nothing below is true of anything but this pane.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is not inside the screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because {@code QuestBookScreen} extends {@code Screen} and needs a running Minecraft to
 * instantiate, so nothing in it can be asserted on. This is the same argument that moved the book's
 * control rectangles into {@link BookGeometry}, and it is here for the same reason: the height this
 * class produces is what the scrollbar's range is computed from, and a scrollbar that disagrees with
 * the drawing is the defect the whole extraction was about.
 *
 * <p>So the composition is a pure function of four counts and a list of strings, and
 * {@code OverlayLayoutTest} can ask it how tall it is without a client. What that test asserts is the
 * property that matters — that the height reported and the rows placed are one computation rather
 * than two that agree — plus the specific advances this pane's appearance was built on.
 *
 * <h2>The advances are deliberate, and are not the kit's defaults</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Stack#heading} reserves four pixels below its text, which is a good default. This pane
 * reserves six, because its rule is drawn at ten pixels and there were six below it before any of
 * this was a stack. Using the kit's default would have moved every row of the overlay by two pixels
 * per section, for a reason that has nothing to do with removing the duplication. So the headings
 * here are built from a gap, a line and a gap — the same three elements, with this screen's numbers.
 *
 * <p>The total is still the kit's, because the kit still computes it. That is the whole point, and it
 * is why the numbers being different from the kit's defaults costs nothing.
 *
 * <h2>The one place this file is a behaviour claim rather than a refactor</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #BODY_TAIL} exists so that the height this produces is <b>exactly</b> what the
 * hand-written {@code measureOverlay} returned. Every other term here is a one-for-one replacement of
 * a line in it. If that claim is wrong the scroll range moves, which is why
 * {@code OverlayLayoutTest} asserts the total against the old arithmetic written out longhand — see
 * its {@code theHeightMatchesTheHandWrittenMeasureItReplaced}.
