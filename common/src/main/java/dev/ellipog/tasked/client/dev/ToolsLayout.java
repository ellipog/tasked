/**
 * The tools panel's composition: a preview, the mode switches, the palette list, the shape and colour
 * sections, and the band that edits one colour.
 *
 * <h2>Docked beside the canvas, not a modal in the middle</h2>
 *
 * <p>It was a centred modal opened by a key of its own, and both halves of that were wrong for the job: a
 * theme editor's whole point is watching the thing you are changing, and a modal covers it. The panel
 * floats over the canvas's right-hand side, inside the book, so the graph a colour belongs to is on screen
 * while the colour changes.
 *
 * <p>It <b>overlays</b> the canvas rather than shrinking it, and that is the one place this departs from
 * "docked". Shrinking the canvas would re-clamp the pan and the zoom under the author's hands every time
 * the panel opened or closed — the thing they were looking at would move — and the panel is a tool for a
 * few minutes at a time. The cost is that nodes under it are hidden while it is open, which closing it
 * restores.
 *
 * <h2>The two things that make it a tool rather than a word list</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each answers a complaint from the first playtest, and each is a <i>rect</i> here rather than a
 * drawing: the panel is game-free and testable, and the drawing is {@code ToolsPanel}'s.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Sections that fold</b>: the palette list and the colours are headings you can collapse,
 *       because forty-three rows and sixteen palettes in one column is a wall.</li>
 *   <li><b>Controls on the rows</b>: a number is dragged or typed where it is named, a colour is a chip
 *       that opens the picker, and the two actions that write the player's own theme sit at the foot of
 *       the book tab.</li>
 * </ul>

     *
     * <p>The four numbered kinds are the redesign's: a {@code field} is a label and a value you can drag
     * or type ({@code ScrubField}); a {@code pair} is two of those sharing one line, with the second half
     * in {@link #right()} -- a field or a choice, whichever the pair needs; a {@code choice} is a label and
     * a word chosen from a list, opened by the triangle in its box ({@code ChoiceField}); and a {@code chip}
     * is a colour as an inline swatch whose press opens the picker. None of them is pressed by being
     * selected, which is what the old {@code ROW} meant for colours -- the redesign's whole point is that
     * the control is at the row rather than in a footer under it.
     *
     * <p><b>And a {@code value} is the one kind with no control at all</b>: a label and a fact the panel
     * itself draws, which is what the chapter tab needs for a file's description and for the quests the
     * chapter lists. It arrived with that tab, and it is the kind that makes "every row is a control" a
     * describable exception rather than an assumption: a reader of the dispatch below can see that one kind
     * is drawn and never pressed.
