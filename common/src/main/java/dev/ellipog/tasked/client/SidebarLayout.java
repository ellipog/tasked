/**
 * The book's sidebar: a collapsible list of group headings and the chapters under them.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, and what it deliberately is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is the <i>particular</i> two-level tree one screen shows in its left column. What it is not is
 * any of the three things it sits between: the outline that decides which rows are visible is
 * {@link Outline}'s, the arithmetic that places them is {@link Stack}'s, and the clipping and
 * hit-testing are {@link dev.ellipog.armature.client.ui.kit.ScrollView}'s. This class exists to join
 * them, and it does nothing else — which is the point, because each of those three was extracted for
 * the same reason: a screen that answers a layout question cannot be asked about it.
 *
 * <p>So {@code SidebarLayoutTest} can assert what is actually true of a sidebar — that a collapsed
 * group hides exactly its own chapters, that a chapter is one indent deeper than its heading, that a
 * heading with no chapters carries no disclosure arrow — without a window, a font or a widget.
 *
 * <h2>Row keys, and why they are prefixed strings rather than ids</h2>
 *
 * <p>A group and a chapter are in <b>different namespaces</b>: {@link
 * dev.ellipog.tasked.quest.QuestIndex} keys groups and chapters in separate tables, so a group called
 * {@code stone_age} and a chapter called {@code stone_age} are both legal and both meaningful, and
 * nothing about either is a mistake. Chip-based keys would collide in the outline — a key is required
 * to be unique — so a perfectly good questline would throw when its sidebar was built.
 *
 * <p>That is not hypothetical for the format this reads: a group folder's id is its folder name and a
 * chapter folder's id is its folder name, and the two kinds of folder are drawn from one vocabulary by
 * one author. {@link #groupKey} and {@link #chapterKey} make the two sets disjoint by construction,
 * which is a stronger guarantee than a naming convention anyone has to remember.
 *
 * <h2>The flat fallback is the empty-group case, and it needs no branch</h2>
 *
 * <p>A server older than groups sends no headings at all, so every chapter arrives with no group and
 * is added to the outline as a <b>root</b>. That draws exactly today's flat chapter list, with no
 * indent and no headings to collapse — which is the right screen for a questline that has no groups,
 * and the same drawing as a version-2 questline that declares an empty group list. So absence needs
 * no flag and no code path: it is the same input, and it produces the same rows.
 *
 * <p><b>Names no Minecraft, and holds no widgets.</b> Every field is a string, a number or a boolean,
 * and {@link #rows} returns values rather than controls — which is what lets the sidebar's behaviour be
 * asserted directly instead of being judged by clicking it.
