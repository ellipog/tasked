/**
 * What a mod with quests supplies to the viewer seam: the snapshots a page is built from, and the
 * live reads its numbers come from.
 *
 * <p>The split is the whole design, and it is a threading rule before it is anything else. A viewer
 * adapter registers recipes at moments no screen is open and, for EMI, on a thread that is not the
 * client thread. So the data that crosses into registration is immutable snapshots
 * ({@link #index()}, {@link #pages()}), and everything that reads a live cache stays behind methods
 * this interface documents as client-thread-only. An adapter that respects the split cannot race the
 * game; one that calls {@link #liveTask} from a registration thread has broken the one rule.
 *
 * <p>{@link #tick()} is where a content implementation notices its own world changing: it is called
 * on the client thread every client tick, and a cheap revision comparison there is what turns "the
 * tree arrived" into a new snapshot without any viewer having to poll anything.
 *
 * <p>The category members are values, not names: an adapter file never hardcodes a category, so the
 * id, the title and the icon all arrive from here. The words are the content's, which is also where
 * their translations live.

     * <h2>Why this is not "walk {@link #pages} and compare"</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because two adapters would write that walk, and both would write it the expensive way round: a
     * lookup answers with the pages for the refs an item index returned, so walking every page per ref is
     * O(pages × refs) for a question whose answer is in a map. That is the same argument
     * {@link ItemQuestIndex} makes for existing at all, one lookup further along — so the map is built
     * where the pages are, and an adapter asks for one.
     *
     * <p>Null is the answer for an id the snapshot does not carry, which is not an error: a ref can name
     * a quest whose page was never built, because a quest with no item rows has no page.
     *
     * <p>Safe to read from any thread, like {@link #pages()} — it is part of the same snapshot.
