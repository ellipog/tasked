/**
 * Each party's choice of {@link PartyMode}, for one world.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not a field on {@code TeamProgress}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a mode is not progress, and the two have different lifetimes. Putting it on
 * {@code TeamProgress} would have been smaller and would have put a party's preference inside the
 * record that <b>{@code /tasked reset} clears</b>: reset with no quest named removes the whole entry,
 * so clearing everybody's progress would silently reset how the party counts. A player who reset a
 * questline would find their party's mode had changed, with nothing connecting the two acts.
 *
 * <p>So they are two files with two rules, and the rule this one follows is: <b>a mode is remembered
 * until the party is gone.</b> Nothing a player does to their progress touches it, and the only thing
 * that forgets one is the party ceasing to exist — see the note on {@link #clear}.
 *
 * <h2>Only parties that chose are stored</h2>
 *
 * <p>An unknown team reads as {@link PartyMode#DEFAULT} rather than being absent, so a world where
 * nobody has ever touched this feature has an empty file rather than one entry per player who logged
 * in. That is the whole of the storage rule: a party appears here once it has said something, and a
 * mode set back to the default stays recorded — which is the truthful reading, because the party
 * chose it, and "chose the default" and "has not chosen" are the same behaviour with different
 * histories.
 *
 * <h2>Saved per world</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@link SavedData} on the overworld, like {@code ProgressStore} and for the same reason: a mode
 * is set on a server, not per dimension. And {@link #put} marks the store dirty itself, so there is
 * no call site that could forget to.

     * <h2>Why this is worth a call rather than being left behind</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because a team id is a fresh {@code UUID} every time a party is formed, so an entry for a
     * disbanded party can never be read again — it is not a stale mode that will be picked up by the
     * next party, it is a line in a file that only ever grows. Clearing on disband is tidiness with a
     * floor under it rather than correctness, and it is the <i>only</i> thing that forgets a mode: a
     * member leaving a party that still exists changes nothing, which is right, because the mode
     * belongs to the party rather than to anybody in it.
     *
     * <p>Idempotent, which it has to be: a disband reaches here once per member for Armature's own
     * teams, since each member gets their own {@code MEMBER_LEFT}.
     *
     * @return whether anything was forgotten, so a caller that cares can tell
