/**
 * How one party's members' counts are combined — the party's answer to <i>"whose progress counts"</i>.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is Tasked's, and not Armature's</h2>
 *
 * <p>The rule that decides where a class lives is Armature's own: <i>"when unsure which repo a class
 * belongs in, put it in Armature"</i>. This one is not unsure, and the reason is not convenience.
 *
 * <p>A <b>party</b> is general, and all of it is already in Armature: membership, roles, invites,
 * events, persistence, and the adapters that read other mods' parties. <b>Combining counts is not
 * general.</b> What a mode combines is "how many oak logs does this member have", and the only thing
 * in either repo with an opinion about oak logs is a quest. Armature's teams are deliberately
 * ignorant of what a team is <i>for</i> — that is the property that makes them reusable by a mod
 * whose teams have nothing to do with quests — and teaching them to combine integers would be the
 * first step in the direction FTB went, where shared progress had to be untangled from the code that
 * owned the progress and became a third mod to ship.
 *
 * <p>So the general primitive is where it belongs already, and what is added here is the one piece
 * that is specifically a quest engine's business. The test for "should this have gone in Armature"
 * is whether another mod could want it; a mod with no quests cannot want this.
 *
 * <h2>The three modes, and which one is the default</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #ONE_MEMBER} is the default, and it is what the engine did unconditionally before a party
 * could choose anything. It is the least that makes "two players share progress correctly" true: a
 * party's quest is satisfied when <i>somebody</i> in it has the items, which is what makes one player
 * gathering work for both. It became an explicit mode rather than staying implicit when the others
 * arrived, because "nobody chose" and "we chose the middle option" should not read the same.
 *
 * <p>{@link #POOLED} adds the members' counts together — a more generous rule, and a real one: eight
 * members carrying one log each would finish a gather-eight quest, and eight members contributing one
 * log each would pay for one. It is the mode where <b>paying</b> changes as well as counting, which
 * is what {@link #takesFromEveryone} exists to say.
 *
 * <p>{@link #OWNER_ONLY} counts nobody but the owner. It is the mode FTB Quests offers first, and its
 * use is a party where one player is doing the progressing and the others are along for the ride.
 *
 * <h2>Two questions, not one, and the second is the one that bites</h2>
 *
 * <p>A mode answers <b>how much</b> and <b>who is holding it</b>. A consuming task's items are taken
 * from the player who was counted, so a mode that answered only the first would record its task
 * satisfied while the items stayed in somebody's pocket — see {@link Tally}.
 *
 * <p>All three keep one invariant: <b>a count of zero has no payer</b>. That is not a coincidence of
 * three similar implementations; it is what the engine uses to tell "nobody has any yet" from
 * "somebody has some", and it is asserted for every mode rather than assumed of them.
 *
 * <h2>Deliberately not a codec here</h2>
 *
 * <p>The file format for a mode is {@link PartyStore}'s business, and it spells a mode by name. A
 * codec on this enum would be a second spelling of the same names — one for a file, one for
 * {@code /tasked party mode} — and the two would drift the first time one was renamed. So
 * {@link #byId} and {@link #ids()} are the single spelling, and the store and the command both go
 * through them.
