 * immediately, NeoForge queues the entry on Tasked's own event bus and creates it later.
 *
 * <p><b>Must run during mod construction.</b> On NeoForge the registration window closes
 * before the game finishes loading, and a late call throws. That is a deliberate design in
 * Armature: a clear failure at construction beats an item that silently does not exist.

     * <h2>Why the guard is here as well as on {@code Tasked.init}</h2>
     *
     * <p>Both are needed and they guard different things. {@code init}'s flag stops a second entry
     * point from re-running <i>initialisation</i>; this one stops <i>this registration</i> from
     * happening twice, however many callers appear. A registration is a one-shot write to a global
     * registry, so the flag belongs at the write — a third entry point, a reload hook or a test that
     * calls this directly would otherwise reintroduce exactly the bug below.
     *
     * <h2>What a second call used to do, because it is silent by default</h2>
     *
     * <p>Nothing threw. {@code MappedRegistry.register} builds a duplicate-key
     * {@code IllegalStateException} and then feeds it to {@code Util.pauseInIde}, which
     * <i>returns</i> it and whose return value the caller discards — so it only ever reports anything
     * when {@code SharedConstants.IS_RUNNING_IN_IDE} is true. In a released game the registry simply
     * gains a second item under the same name with a different raw id, and the failure surfaces much
     * later and elsewhere: joining a server, where {@code fabric-registry-sync} cannot remap the
     * client's item-model map and disconnects with
     * <i>"Map contained two equal IDs … (tasked:quest_book/1335 -> tasked:quest_book/1334)"</i>.
     *
     * <p>Armature's {@code FabricRegistrar} now refuses a duplicate id for every mod, which is where
     * a general fix belongs — this flag is the specific one, and it means the mistake cannot be made
     * here at all.
