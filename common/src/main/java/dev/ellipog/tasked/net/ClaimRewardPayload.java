/**
 * A player pressing Claim in the quest book.
 *
 * <h2>What the client is allowed to say, and what it is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>This carries a quest id and nothing else. It is a <b>request</b>, not a statement of fact: the
 * client does not say "these rewards are owed" and could not be believed if it did. It says "I would
 * like to collect quest X", and the server decides whether anything is owed by looking at its own
 * stored progress — the same {@code ProgressService.canClaim} that the command and the wire format
 * use, so a claim that arrives for a quest with nothing waiting is refused rather than honoured.
 *
 * <p>That is why there is no amount, no item and no count on this payload. A payload that could name
 * what it wanted would be a payload a modified client could point at a diamond.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link SubmitTaskPayload}, which can fail for four different reasons, a claim has exactly
 * one interesting outcome: it worked, or it did not. So there is no response payload; success and
 * failure are both learned from the progress sync that follows, which is the same one every other
 * change sends.
 *
 * @param questId the quest, by id or alias
