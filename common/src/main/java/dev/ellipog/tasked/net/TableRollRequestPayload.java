/**
 * A client asking what a table's dice would do, without granting anything.
 *
 * <h2>Why the server rolls rather than the client</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a roll is not a property of one file: an entry can point at another table, and resolving
 * "how often did the rare bag come up" needs every table the first one can reach. A client holds the one
 * file it is editing and a summary of the rest, which is enough to draw a table and not enough to roll
 * one — so the editor asks, and the answer is what it draws.
 *
 * <h2>Why the whole mode travels rather than a flag</h2>
 *
 * <p>It sent {@code includeEmpty}, and the server read it as {@code LOOT} or {@code RANDOM} — which
 * collapsed the four readings an author can select into two. With the editor's chip on {@code all_table}
 * or {@code choice}, the report came back as a weighted roll of a table whose own panel said every entry
 * is granted, and the pane printed "rolls as random" underneath that chip. One field with four values
 * cannot lose two of them; a boolean derived from it can, and did.
 *
 * @param address the table, named or inline
 * @param rolls   how many grants to simulate; the server clamps it rather than trusting it
 * @param mode    the reading being previewed, exactly as the editor's chip names it
