/**
 * The quest tree: one chunk of it, plus how many quests and chapters the whole tree holds.
 *
 * <h2>One payload, and the counts are not redundant</h2>
 *
 * <p>The counts ride on every chunk rather than only the last because the client uses them before it
 * has parsed anything — "20 quests in 4 chapters" is shown while the rest arrives, and the client can
 * tell a server with no quests from a server whose message has not finished. Recomputing them from
 * the tree would only be possible at the end, which is the moment they stop being useful.
 *
 * <h2>What changed here, and why the first version was wrong</h2>
 *
 * <p>This used to carry the whole tree as one {@code BYTE_ARRAY}, uncompressed. That is correct for
 * the shipped example questline and stops being correct at the scale the plan is written for: a pack
 * with a few thousand quests is a multi-megabyte packet, and vanilla's own fallback codec for an
 * unknown payload — {@code MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 1048576} — says plainly what a payload is expected to
 * hold. The limit is not enforced against a registered payload, which is the trap: nothing throws,
 * and the failure appears as a stalled or dropped connection with no size in the message.
 *
 * <p>So the field is a chunk of a packed message, and {@link SyncChunk} says where it sits. The
 * reassembled bytes are deflated JSON, and {@link SyncWire#unpack} turns them back into the shape the
 * client's parser already reads — so the client's parsing code did not have to change at all, which
 * is the property that made this a safe thing to do to a working wire format.
 *
 * <h2>Why the codec is declared as {@code ? super RegistryFriendlyByteBuf}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Unchanged from the first version, and the reason is now load-bearing in a second place:
 * {@code ByteBufCodecs.BYTE_ARRAY} is defined over {@code ByteBuf}, not
 * {@code RegistryFriendlyByteBuf}, so {@code StreamCodec.composite} infers {@code ByteBuf} as the
 * buffer type. Declaring the field as {@code StreamCodec<RegistryFriendlyByteBuf, ...>} therefore
 * does not compile, even though {@code ByteBuf} is a supertype of it. {@code ? super} matches both
 * what comes out and what both loaders want — Fabric's {@code playS2C().register} and NeoForge's
 * {@code playToClient} both take {@code StreamCodec<? super RegistryFriendlyByteBuf, T>}.
 *
 * @param questCount   how many quests the whole tree holds, not just this chunk
 * @param chapterCount how many chapters, for a summary the client can show before parsing
 * @param chunk        where this chunk sits in the message
 * @param data         this chunk's packed bytes — see {@link SyncWire#pack}

     * {@code new Type(ResourceLocation.withDefaultNamespace(name))} — it takes a <i>path</i> and
     * hardcodes the {@code minecraft} namespace, because it exists for vanilla's own payloads. So
     * passing it {@code "tasked:quest_sync"} produces the location {@code minecraft:tasked:quest_sync},

     *
     * <pre>Non [a-z0-9/._-] character in path of location: minecraft:tasked:quest_sync</pre>
     *
     * <p>The constructor takes a real {@link ResourceLocation} and accepts a namespace, which is what
     * a mod's payload needs. Worth reading as a rule: when a factory method in vanilla takes a string
     * and the error names a location you did not write, check whether it prepends a namespace.
