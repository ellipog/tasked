/**
 * The server's verdict on a choice pick.
 *
 * <h2>Why the picker needs an answer</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a pick the player just made must not vanish into a toast. The card stays open with the
 * chosen row disabled until this arrives: {@link Result#OK} closes it and moves to the next queued
 * offer, and the two refusals are drawn <b>on the card</b>, so the player can make room, choose a
 * different entry, or leave — instead of watching their decision be discarded and the next question
 * appear.
 *
 * <p>{@link Result#NO_SPACE} is separate from {@link Result#REFUSED} because the sentences differ:
 * one is about the inventory and is the player's to fix, the other is about the reward and is not.
 *
 * @param questId     the quest the answered offer belonged to, as the offer named it
 * @param rewardIndex which of its rewards was answered
 * @param result      what the server did with the answer
