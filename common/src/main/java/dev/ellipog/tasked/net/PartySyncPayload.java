/**
 * A party's roster, as it goes to a client.
 *
 * <h2>Sent when the membership changes, and on join</h2>
 *
 * <p>This rides the same pushes as the progress sync, which is what makes it cheap: a team's
 * membership changing is <i>already</i> an event somebody acts on — see {@code Tasked}'s listeners —
 * so a roster update costs one more message on a change that was going to send one anyway, and
 * nothing at all on a tick where nothing moved.
 *
 * <p>A roster cannot be sent only on request, and that is the tempting design: the panel could ask
 * when it opens. What that misses is that the panel is <b>open while the membership changes</b> —
 * somebody accepts an invite, an officer removes somebody — and a roster that only refreshed when the
 * panel was opened would be a panel showing a party that is no longer the one you are in.
 *
 * <h2>Two components, and the id rides the roster</h2>
 *
 * <p>There used to be a third: the team id, as two longs rather than a string, fixed size and no
 * parsing. It was never read — the handler consumes the packed roster alone — and the same id is the
 * first header line {@link PartySnapshot#unpack} reads back, so the payload was carrying a second copy
 * of a fact it already held. The ceiling is six; the roster is one string.
 *
 * @param packed {@link PartySnapshot#pack()} — the roster, as one string
