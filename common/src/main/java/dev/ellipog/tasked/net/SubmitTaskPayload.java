/**
 * A player pressing a task in the quest book.
 *
 * <h2>The whole of the client's authority</h2>
 *
 * <p>This is the only thing a client can ask the server to do about quests, and it asks for exactly
 * one thing: "I am submitting task N of quest X". It cannot complete a quest, cannot grant a reward,
 * and cannot claim to have done the task. The server looks up whether that task is unlocked, whether
 * it can be submitted by hand, and whether the items are actually there — the same checks
 * {@code /tasked submit} runs.
 *
 * <p>That is why there is no "complete this quest" payload. A client that can assert progress is a
 * client that can be made to assert progress it did not earn, and syncing a claimed result is a cheat
 * vector with extra steps.
 *
 * <p>The quest id is a bounded string rather than a free one. A client can send anything, so the codec
 * refuses anything that could not be an id before it reaches a lookup.
 *
 * @param questId   the quest, by id or alias
 * @param taskIndex which task in it
