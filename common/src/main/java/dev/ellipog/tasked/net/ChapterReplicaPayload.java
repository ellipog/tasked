/**
 * A chapter's quests, whole, on their way to a client that asked for them.
 *
 * <h2>One payload, and the number that says it can be</h2>
 *
 * <p>Measured rather than hoped: {@code ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket.MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE} is <b>1048576</b>
 * bytes in this version, so a chapter travels as one message. The examples are tens of kilobytes and a large
 * hand-written pack with two hundred quests in it is a few hundred — an order of magnitude under the cap, with
 * the id and a quest's own fields no larger than anybody types. If a pack ever does exceed it the failure is a
 * refusal the client can see, not a truncated chapter, because the codec's limit is the check.
 *
 * <p>Encoded as a JSON object of id to that quest's tree — the same shape the files are in, so the client's
 * copy is a copy rather than a translation.
 *
 * @param chapter     the chapter the quests belong to
 * @param quests      every quest's tree, keyed by id
 * @param chapterTree the chapter's own file -- title, icon, rules, quest list -- as one tree
