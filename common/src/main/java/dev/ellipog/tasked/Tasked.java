     * <h2>Called twice on a client, which is the whole reason this is guarded</h2>
     *
     * <p>Every loader gives Tasked <b>two</b> entry points, and a client runs both:
     * {@code TaskedFabric.onInitialize} and {@code TaskedFabricClient.onInitializeClient} on Fabric,
     * {@code TaskedNeoForge} and {@code TaskedNeoForgeClient} on NeoForge. Dedicated servers run only
     * the first of each pair, which is why the server log has always shown one line and this was
     * never seen from there. Both client initialisers call {@code init()} on purpose — each is
     * written to work even if the other ran second, so that payload registration cannot depend on a
     * load order the loader does not promise.
     *
     * <p>So the guard is what makes that "defensively, whatever order" claim true rather than
     * hopeful. Two of the three things below were already independently idempotent —
     * {@code TaskedNetworking.declare} has its own flag for exactly this hazard, and
     * {@code ArmatureNetwork.install} keeps the first backend — and the third did not.
     *
     * <h2>What happened without it, since it is a genuinely misleading failure</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@code QuestBook.register()} wrote the same id twice, and <b>vanilla does not refuse
     * that</b>. {@code MappedRegistry.register} checks and then does not act on the result:
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     * if (this.byLocation.containsKey(key.location())) {
     *     Util.pauseInIde(new IllegalStateException("Adding duplicate key '" + key + "'"));
     * }   // <- no `throw`. The return value is discarded.
     * }</pre>
     *
     * <p>and {@code Util.pauseInIde} <i>returns</i> the exception rather than throwing it —
     * {@code if (IS_RUNNING_IN_IDE) { LOGGER.error(...); doPause(...); } return t;}. In a released game
     * that branch is false, so the entire check is a no-op and the registry ends up holding two items
     * under one name with two different raw ids.
     *
     * <p>The symptom then appears somewhere else entirely, twenty minutes later and at the one moment
     * a player is doing something: joining a world. {@code fabric-registry-sync} remaps the client's
     * registries to the server's and refuses —
     * <i>"Map contained two equal IDs 1334 (tasked:quest_book/1335 -> tasked:quest_book/1334)"</i> —
     * which disconnects the client before it finishes connecting. Nothing in that message names
     * Tasked's init, an entry point, or the item; it names a map inside Minecraft's client.
     *
     * <p><b>The tell was in the log the whole time.</b> The line below is inside this guard, so
     * {@code "Tasked loaded on Fabric (production)"} appearing <i>twice</i> in one startup is exactly
     * the thing that pointed here — which is worth keeping in mind the next time two lines that
     * should be one appear in a log. Armature's {@code FabricRegistrar} now refuses a duplicate id
     * outright, so this class of bug fails at construction with the id named rather than at connect.

     *
     * <p>It was beside them, and that was wrong in a way worth recording. A team event only ever
     * fires from a server, and {@link ArmatureEvents#SERVER_STARTED} is <b>fired by loader code in
     * each loader's subproject</b> — so registering here makes the subscription part of "a server
     * exists" rather than part of "this class was initialised". The two coincide in production and do
     * not in a test, and that difference is the useful part: a test JVM never fires a lifecycle event,
     * so nothing in Tasked's tests can come to depend on a team event having been subscribed, because
     * it never is there. That is a constraint on the tests rather than on Tasked, and it is the reason
     * the guard below is worth having.
     *
     * <p>It also means the resolution happens at a moment when a server definitely exists, which is
     * what the source probe wants — see {@code TeamProviders} for why the resolution is lazy rather
     * than waiting for this.
     *
     * <p>Guarded by a flag because {@code SERVER_STARTED} fires once per server and a process can host
     * more than one — a single-player world, a disconnect, another world. Without the flag the second
     * server would log every membership change twice, which reads as a duplicated event rather than as
     * a duplicated listener.
     *
     * <h2>What the log line on the first tick of a server is for</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@code Teams.of(server).name()} is {@code "stored"} on a server running nothing else, and
     * the id of a parties mod on a server running one. Printed at startup rather than on the first
     * team command, because the useful moment to find out which source a server resolved to is before
     * anybody asks — and because "both parties mods are installed and this one won" is a decision
     * that is otherwise invisible. See {@code TeamProviders} for why that decision is a heuristic.
