/**
 * Reads {@code config/tasked/quests/} and turns it into a {@link QuestIndex}.
 *
 * <h2>The pipeline, and why in that order</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Parse</b> with {@link JsonDocument}, so every value has a line and a column.</li>
 *   <li><b>Validate</b> against the format — required fields, unknown fields, enum names, item
 *       existence. If this finds anything fatal, the file is <b>not decoded</b>.</li>
 *   <li><b>Decode</b> with the codecs, which is the only step that produces a {@link QuestFile}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Index</b> across all files, which is where duplicate ids and dangling dependencies are
 *       caught.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Step 2 before step 3 is the load-bearing bit. A codec ignores fields it does not recognise and
 * reports failures without positions, so decoding first would mean an author sees one message per
 * reload, in the wrong place. Validating first means one pass reports everything, each at its own
 * line.
 *
 * <p>Files that fail are skipped rather than aborting the load. A questline of ten files with one
 * broken should still load the other nine — that is the difference between a typo being a nuisance
 * and it being a dead server.
 *
 * <h2>It reads, and only reads</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here creates, writes, renames or deletes anything — not even the quest directory itself.
 * That is a rule, and it was arrived at by getting it wrong twice.
 *
 * <p>The first version copied a questline out of the jar whenever the directory was <i>absent</i>. So
 * a shipped file could only ever reach an install at the moment that install was created, and adding
 * a second one to the jar reached nobody: every existing install already had the directory. The
 * second version fixed that by recording which files had been offered and offering the rest — a
 * bigger machine for a smaller problem, and still a mod writing content into a directory that belongs
 * to whoever is playing.
 *
 * <p>The rule that replaced both: <b>the mod ships no quests.</b> A quest file belongs to the person
 * who wrote it, and a loader that also writes has an opinion about content it has no business having
 * an opinion about — a player who installs Tasked wants a quest engine, not three example chapters
 * to delete, and every file a mod ships is a file that has to keep working forever against a format
 * that is still moving.
 *
 * <p>So the worked examples live in the repository, at {@code tasked/tools/quests}, and reach a
 * config directory because somebody ran {@code tasked/tools/seed_quests.py}. That script's header
 * says why it is there rather than here; the short version is that deleting a file you wrote is a
 * different act from discovering one you did not.
 *
 * <p>Two consequences are visible from outside, and both are intended:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>An absent directory is reported, not created.</b> The warning names the full path, which
 *       is the useful half of what the old code did, without the write.</li>
 *   <li><b>A fresh install has no quests.</b> An empty book is the designed state rather than a
 *       failure, and it is what a pack author starts from.</li>
 * </ul>

     * Decodes every declaration discovery found, and assembles them into one tree.
     *
     * <h2>Two phases, because a group cannot be built before its chapters are</h2>
     *
     * <p>A {@link ChapterGroup} holds its {@code Chapter}s, and a {@link Chapter} holds its
     * {@code Quest}s — so a group's piece cannot be emitted until everything underneath it has been
     * decoded, while the declarations arrive group-first. Phase one walks the declarations in order and
     * nests each one under the group or chapter it belongs to; phase two builds the records bottom-up
     * and emits the pieces.
     *
     * <p>Nesting by the {@code parentDisplay} each declaration already carries, rather than by matching
     * order, is what makes a chapter whose manifest failed to decode take only <i>its own</i> quests down
     * with it. The quests are still under it in the walk — they hang off the chapter's manifest — so they
     * are skipped with it, which is right: a quest is not loaded if the chapter it belongs to is not.
     *
     * <h2>{@code $schema} and the per-kind validators</h2>
     *
     * <p>Each kind is validated by <i>its own</i> entry point, so the field sets are per-kind — a chapter
     * field in a group's manifest is an error — and the positions are the file's own, because the path
     * for a per-kind document is {@code $}. Validation first, decode second, exactly as for version 1
     * and for the same reason: one mistake should produce one message, not a validator complaint
     * followed by a codec complaint about the same field.
