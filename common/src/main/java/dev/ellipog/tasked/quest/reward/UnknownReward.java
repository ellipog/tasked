/**
 * A reward whose type this build has no codec for, kept rather than thrown away.
 *
 * <p>The reward half of {@link dev.ellipog.tasked.quest.task.UnknownTask}, and the argument for it is
 * the same one: a codec error refuses the whole document, so before this a single reward naming an
 * addon that is not installed cost the author every quest in the file. See {@code TypeDispatch}.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@link #autoGrantable()} is false</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is the one place this record makes a decision rather than staying inert, and it is the decision
 * that matters. An automatic payout path <b>marks a reward collected and then grants it</b>; for a
 * reward whose behaviour this build does not have, that would mark it collected and grant nothing —
 * losing it for good, with no row left to claim. {@code QuestReward.autoGrantable}'s javadoc names
 * exactly this fault for a choice reward, and the answer is the same: leave it outstanding so the
 * normal claim flow still offers it, and the row says why it cannot be paid.
 *
 * <p>{@link RewardCommon#DEFAULT} rather than null, for the reason given on {@code UnknownTask.of}.
