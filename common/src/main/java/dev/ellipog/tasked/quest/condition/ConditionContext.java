/**
 * Who a condition is being asked about, and on what server.
 *
 * <p>A condition is asked once per player — the member whose count is being read on a shared task, or
 * the player a reward is being paid to — so the player here is the subject, not "the team". A party
 * condition is the same predicate for every member; a stage, inventory or score condition is not, and
 * the engine's per-member asking is what makes that the natural reading rather than a special case.
 *
 * @param player the player the condition is asked about
 * @param server the server they are on
 * @param owner  the progress owner this evaluation belongs to — the UUID a party's shared progress is
 *               keyed by. No condition reads it today: {@code tasked:party_size} asks the
 *               <b>player</b>, resolving them to their team itself, because the subject of a
 *               condition is the player and never the team. It is here because the evaluation has to
 *               know whose progress it is resolving, and a party condition is the one that looked
 *               like it might be the exception.
