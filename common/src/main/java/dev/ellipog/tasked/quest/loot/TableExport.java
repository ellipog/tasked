/**
 * A table's items, as stacks, and where they go.
 *
 * <h2>What an export is for</h2>
 *
 * <p>Batch editing: an author wants the table's items in front of them, in a chest, to rearrange and
 * compare. So an entry's <b>configured count</b> is what travels — {@code torches x16} is a stack of
 * sixteen, {@code iron x192} is three stacks of sixty-four — because a chest that said "one iron" for an
 * entry that grants a hundred and ninety-two would be a working set that lies about the table.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is destroyed, and the report says where everything went</h2>
 *
 * <p>The container gets <b>empty slots only</b>: a chest with sixteen iron in it already is not part of
 * the working set, and merging into it would mix an author's pre-existing items into the export. Then
 * the player's own inventory, which is an ordinary insertion and where merging is what inventories do.
 * Then the ground, at the player's feet. Every one of the three counts is reported, so an overflow is
 * something the author is told about rather than something they find later.
 *
 * <h2>Nesting is a view, not a round trip</h2>
 *
 * <p>By default only the table's own item entries are exported, and the rest are counted and named as
 * skipped. Resolving nested tables is available because "everything this table can produce" is a real
 * question — but the flattened chest cannot be imported back into the same table without turning its
 * modular sub-tables into a flat list of entries, so the command that asks for it says so.

     *
     * <h2>Why one walk returns all three</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because they are three answers about one traversal. This used to be {@code stacks(...)} and a
     * separate {@code skipped(...)}, which walked the table a second time and counted only the top
     * level — so with {@code nested} the stacks descended into child tables while the count did not,
     * and a report could say "2 skipped" about a table that had skipped nine. The separate method was
     * also never called by anything, so the sentence it existed for (see {@link Result#skipped}) never
     * printed at all: the count was hardcoded to zero at the one place that read it.
     *
     * @param stacks     the items, as stacks a chest can hold
     * @param skipped    entries that are not items this walk could put in a chest — a non-item reward,
     *                   a table reference it was not asked to open, a choice, a missing table, a loop,
     *                   or one cut off at {@link RewardTable#MAX_NESTING}
     * @param randomised entries exported at their <b>minimum</b>: they carry a {@code randomBonus}, so
     *                   the roll that grants them may hand over more than the chest shows
