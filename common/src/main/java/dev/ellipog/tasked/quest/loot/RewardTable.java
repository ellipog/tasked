/**
 * A named roll of rewards: the payload of {@code random}, {@code loot}, {@code all_table} and
 * {@code choice}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * { "emptyWeight": 10, "lootSize": 2, "title": "Tier 1 Minerals",
 *   "icon": { "item": "minecraft:iron_ingot" },
 *   "entries": [ { "weight": 0, "reward": { "type": "tasked:item", "item": "minecraft:stone" } },
 *                { "weight": 5, "reward": { "type": "tasked:xp", "amount": 30 } } ] }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>The roll is FTB Quests', weights and all</h2>
 *
 * <p>A weight-zero entry is <b>always</b> granted, once per roll call — it is how a table says "and
 * everyone also gets this". Every positive weight shares the rest of the probability space, and
 * {@code lootSize} is how many times the dice are thrown. {@code emptyWeight} is the chance of
 * nothing on a throw, and only the {@code loot} mode includes it: a {@code random} reward promises
 * something, and a {@code loot} reward is allowed to promise nothing.
 *
 * <p>Kept as pure arithmetic on a {@link RandomSource} handed in, so the distribution is testable
 * with a seeded source rather than by playing. {@link #rollIndices} is the arithmetic itself — a roll
 * as <i>positions</i> rather than rewards — which is what lets a caller tally a distribution
 * ({@link #odds} explains the chances, and the editor's test roll counts the positions) without a
 * second description of the same dice.
 *
 * <h2>Title, icon and handle</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three fields exist for the visual editor rather than for the roll, and all three are optional so
 * that every file written before them still reads:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code title} — what the table is called in the browser and on a reward's badge. Absent (or
 *       blank, which the compact constructor treats as absent) means the id, prettified.</li>
 *   <li>{@code icon} — the stack a browser row draws. Absent means the first entry that has an item,
 *       then that entry's type icon; see {@link #displayIcon()}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code uid} — the handle of a table written <b>inline</b> in a quest or another table. A file's
 *       root table has no use for one, and the loader ignores it there; see {@code InlineTables} for
 *       why an inline table is addressed by a handle rather than by its position.</li>
 * </ul>
