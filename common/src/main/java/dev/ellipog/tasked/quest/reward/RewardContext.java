/**
 * What a reward is allowed to touch when it is granted.
 *
 * <p>The player, and the facts about where the payout came from that a reward may legitimately need
 * to name: the server (to run a command), the team whose claim it answers, the quest and chapter ids
 * (for placeholders), and the online members (for a count). Nothing here reads or writes quest
 * <i>progress</i> — if a reward needs to, it is not a reward, it is a task. Keeping progress out is
 * what stops that distinction eroding.
 *
 * <p>The empty strings and the singleton member list of {@link #of} are the shape a reward sees when
 * it is granted outside a quest context (a command, a script), not a valid quest identity.
 *
 * <p>{@code feedback} is where a reward reports what it could not hand over — the items a full
 * inventory left on the ground. It is part of the context because it is about the <i>grant</i>, and
 * the claim operation that owns the context is the only place that can turn twenty drops into one
 * sentence. See {@link RewardFeedback}.
