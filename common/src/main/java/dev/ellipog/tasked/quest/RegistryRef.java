     * <h2>Why this is a {@code comapFlatMap} and not the {@code xmap} it was</h2>
     *
     * <p>It was {@code Codec.STRING.xmap(RegistryRef::parse, RegistryRef::wire)}, and {@link #parse}
     * throws for a string that is neither an id nor a tag. A {@code Decoder}'s {@code map} has no
     * try/catch — DFU does not catch what an {@code xmap} function throws — so the exception left the
     * codec as a raw throwable rather than a {@code DataResult} error.
     *
     * <p>Two callers then had no way to survive it, and both are reachable from an ordinary typo in a
     * quest file:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code QuestValidator.decodeEntry} asks a registered type's own codec whether its fields
     *       form a value. That call is inside the validator, so a malformed {@code biome} threw out of
     *       validation and out of {@code QuestLoader.load} — which has no try/catch either.</li>
     *   <li>{@code QuestLoader.decode} handles a {@code DataResult} error and has no try/catch, so the
     *       same typo escaped the loader the same way.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The only handler above either of them is {@code TaskedQuests.loadOnServerStart}, which catches
     * at the top: the result was <b>the entire questline failing to load</b> — every chapter, in every
     * file — because one {@code "biome"} was misspelled. A codec that reports through its return type
     * costs the author that one file and one message with a line number, which is the whole reason this
     * project validates before it decodes.
     *
     * <p>{@link #parse} still throws, and deliberately: its other callers are this mod's own default
     * values, written as literals two lines away from it, where a throw is a bug in the code rather
     * than in somebody's file. The codec is the reader for a value that came from a file, so the codec
     * is the one that has to answer instead of throwing.
