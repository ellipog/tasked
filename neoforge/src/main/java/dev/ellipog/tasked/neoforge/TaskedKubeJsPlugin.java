/**
 * The KubeJS integration: what a script sees of Tasked.
 *
 * <h2>NeoForge only, and that is KubeJS's doing rather than a choice</h2>
 *
 * <p>KubeJS 7 — the 1.21 line — is NeoForge-only: its Fabric artifact stops at 1.20.1. So this class lives in
 * {@code :neoforge}, and the operations it exposes live in {@code :common}'s {@link TaskedScripts}, which
 * names none of KubeJS's types and would be reusable unchanged if a Fabric integration ever exists again.
 *
 * <h2>How KubeJS finds this class</h2>
 *
 * <p>Through {@code kubejs.plugins.txt}, a plain resource in this module listing plugin class names — KubeJS
 * reads it out of every mod's jar (its own has no service file to copy, and no annotation: the file is the
 * marker). Its absence is silent, which is why the file and the class are written together and why the
 * dev run that proves them is part of the same change rather than a later idea.
 *
 * <h2>Verifying it, and what the verification found</h2>
 *
 * <p>It was run, not assumed: {@code :neoforge:runServer} with KubeJS on the run classpath and a script at
 * {@code run/kubejs/server_scripts/} that prints what it can see. The log then carries KubeJS's own
 * {@code Found plugin source tasked} — the file was read — followed by the script's lines: the {@code Tasked}
 * binding is an object, its methods are callable, a call answers ({@code state(null, "nothing")} is
 * {@code UNKNOWN}), a {@code TaskedEvents.stageAdded} listener attaches, and a JS arrow function converts
 * into a custom-type handler — {@code registerTask} and {@code registerReward} land in their registries,
 * which is the one thing here that could not be read off the artifact. Two things that only a real run
 * reveals, both now written into the build: the dev run needs Armature's own mod on the classpath (a player's
 * instance has it; a dev run did not), and modern KubeJS requires a recent NeoForge — hence the version in
 * {@code gradle.properties}.
 *
 * <h2>Two halves to a plugin</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #init} connects Tasked's own events to the script events, one for one, so a script listens at the
 * same moments a mod does. {@link #registerBindings} and {@link #registerEvents} publish the {@code Tasked}
 * object and the {@code TaskedEvents} group. Both halves must be present for a script to do anything
 * useful, and neither does anything when KubeJS is not installed — this class is only loaded when KubeJS
 * reads the file above.
