/**
 * Armature's networking, on NeoForge.
 *
 * <h2>Registration is deferred here, and that is the point of the SPI</h2>
 *
 * <p>NeoForge will not accept a payload registration during mod construction — it wants them inside
 * {@link RegisterPayloadHandlersEvent}, which fires later. So {@link #register} cannot do the work
 * itself; it records the registration and {@link #onRegisterPayloads} performs it when the event
 * arrives.
 *
 * <p>That is exactly the difference the platform layer exists to hide. Fabric registers immediately
 * and NeoForge cannot, and a mod that had to know which would be a mod with two versions of its setup
 * code. Here the declaration is written once and each loader takes it at the moment it accepts one.
 *
 * <h2>Both directions in one call</h2>
 *
 * <p>Unlike Fabric, NeoForge's registrar takes the format <i>and</i> the handler together, with the
 * direction chosen by which method is called. So {@code Registration.direction()} maps onto a method
 * name rather than onto two separate registrations — a smaller translation than Fabric's.
