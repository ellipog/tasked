 * NeoForge's client half.

 * {@code KeyMapping}, {@code Screen} and the client event classes.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing to register for payloads here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Unlike Fabric, NeoForge's {@code RegisterPayloadHandlersEvent} fires on the client too — so
 * {@link NeoForgeNetworking#onRegisterPayloads} already registered the client-bound handlers, and
 * doing it again here would be a duplicate registration rather than a missing one. The asymmetry with
 * Fabric is worth knowing: Fabric needs a second registration call on the client, NeoForge does not.
