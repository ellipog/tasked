/**
 * NeoForge's inventory access: the platform's own transfer, over the main inventory only.
 *
 * <h2>Why the wrapper is ranged, and why that is not a detail</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code InvWrapper} over a {@code PlayerInventory} presents all 41 slots — 36 main, 4 armor, 1
 * offhand — and {@code ItemHandlerHelper.insertItemStacked} would happily use an empty armor slot as
 * capacity. Vanilla's automatic insertion never does that (see {@code InventorySpace} for the rules,
 * read from the artefact), so an unwrapped handler would make the simulation promise space that the
 * game would refuse, which is exactly the failure this class exists to prevent. The range is
 * therefore clamped to the 36 main slots.
 *
 * <p><b>One deliberate difference from vanilla, stated rather than hidden.</b> Vanilla also merges
 * into an offhand slot that already holds a matching stack; this implementation does not, because a
 * ranged handler cannot express "merge here, never place here". The two loaders can therefore differ
 * in one corner — a full main inventory with a part-filled offhand — where NeoForge refuses a reward
 * that Fabric would merge. Refusing is the safe direction, and both methods here agree with each
 * other, which is what the strict claim path actually needs.
