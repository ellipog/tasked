/**
 * Fabric entry point.
 *
 * <p>Four lines, and the order of them is the only interesting part:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code Tenet.init()} declares the payloads. It has to come first — installation reads the
 *       declarations and registers them, so anything declared afterwards is never seen.</li>
 *   <li>{@code ArmatureNetwork.install(...)} hands the loader over, which registers every declared
 *       payload's <b>format</b> on both sides.</li>
 *   <li>{@code FabricNetworking.registerReceivers()} registers the <b>server-side receivers</b>. Done
 *       here rather than in the client initialiser because a client with an integrated server is a
 *       server, and it receives the same packets a dedicated one would.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Runs on client and server both. Nothing here may touch a client class —
 * {@link TenetFabricClient} exists for that, and it is a separate entry point precisely so the
 * server never loads it.
