/**
 * Fabric's client half.
 *
 * <p>Separate from {@link TenetFabric} so a dedicated server never loads this class, and so never
 * tries to load {@code KeyMapping}, {@code Screen} or {@code ClientPlayNetworking}.
 *
 * <h2>Five things, and each has a reason for being here</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The screen</b>, registered before the key is declared — or the key would open nothing.</li>
 *   <li><b>The key mapping</b>, declared through Armature so NeoForge's different timing is not this
 *       class's problem.</li>
 *   <li><b>The HUD</b>, which is the one thing here that draws outside a screen: Fabric hands a frame's
 *       context to {@code HudRenderCallback}, and everything about what to draw with it is Tenet's.</li>
 *   <li><b>The client tick</b>, which advances the tick counter cooldowns count down from, and polls
 *       the key.</li>
 *   <li><b>The disconnect hook</b>, which clears the cache. Without it, leaving one server and joining
 *       another shows the first server's questline until the new sync arrives — which looks exactly
 *       like a sync failure and is not one.</li>
 * </ul>
