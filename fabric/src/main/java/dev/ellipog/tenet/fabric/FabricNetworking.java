/**
 * The server half of Fabric's networking.
 *
 * <h2>Fabric registers in two parts, and the split matters</h2>
 *
 * <p>Half of registering a payload is about the <b>format</b> — which codec reads it — and both sides
 * need that, because both serialise. The other half is about the <b>receiver</b>, and Fabric wants
 * that registered separately and per side: {@code ServerPlayNetworking} for packets arriving at a
 * server, {@code ClientPlayNetworking} for packets arriving at a client.
 *
 * <p>So {@link #register} does the format half, and it runs from the <i>common</i> initialiser so it
 * happens on both sides. {@link #registerReceivers()} does the server-receiver half and also runs
 * from the common initialiser — a client with an integrated server is a server too, so it needs those
 * receivers registered. The client-receiver half is in {@link FabricClientNetworking}, which only a
 * client loads.
 *
 * <p>NeoForge takes both halves in one call. That difference is the entire reason
 * {@link NetworkBackend} exists.
